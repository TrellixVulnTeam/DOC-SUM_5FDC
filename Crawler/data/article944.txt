As Pakistan mourns the death of philanthropist and humanitarian Abdul Sattar Edhi, news channels are extensively and justifiably covering the news. But, it seems, one news reporter might have just gone overboard.
According to a tweet that has gone viral, a reporter from News Express decided to inform his viewers of the details of the burial of Pakistan’s hero Edhi, who passed away in Karachi on July 8 at the age of 88 — from the social activist’s grave!
According to the tweet, the reporter seems to be reporting from Edhi’s grave which he reportedly prepared for himself in Edhi village 25 years ago.

The reporter is being slammed on social media for his act, but the bigger question is: Is this the kind of journalism one must now come to expect? Such are the examples that makes one believe that Peepli Live is very real and true. Only a couple of days back, another video of a TV reporter trying to force a child to say what he wanted on camera went viral when the child went ‘off script’ and spoke the truth.
Watch that video here.
We can’t verify if the reporter is reporting from Edhi’s grave but the picture does pose a grave question on the kind of journalism being currently practised.
