Shah Rukh Khan is modesty personified whenever it comes to talking about his earnings and him topping wealth lists of international magazines year after year.

SRK quipped about him topping the list by saying Mummy Mummy main phir se amir ban gaya.
Talking about achieving the numero uno position in the wealth list, SRK said, “I don’t know what to say. I feel embarrassed about it. There are a lot of people behind me who take care of my business. So their efforts cannot be undermined. Just like in films where it is made by someone else and my face is used, even in business it is managed by someone else and my face is used on magazines. I like it though because I give good interviews but only after asking my associates how to go about it. Also being on Forbes is a good thing because it gives recognition to the kind of business that we are doing.”
