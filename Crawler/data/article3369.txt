The bail plea of self-styled godman Asaram, who is in jail in connection with a rape case, was on Friday rejected by a sessions court.
This is the sixth bail application of 74-year-old Asaram which has been rejected by the court. He was sent to jail in August, 2013 for allegedly sexually assaulting a 16-year-old school girl.
Citing the order of the court, the victim’s counsel, P C Solanki said, “The court did not consider the arguments like the age of Asaram and delayed FIR by the girl”.
Asaram was represented in court by BJP leader Subramanian Swamy.
Swamy had appeared in the court on Monday to plead on the bail application.
The court had completed the arguments on bail application on Monday itself and had reserved the order for today.
While Asaram was not in court, a large number of his supporters were present.
