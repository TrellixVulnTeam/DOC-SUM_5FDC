Househusbands are a rare breed in India. But isn’t it delightful to see a man whose only ambition in life is to take care of his house while his wife brings in the money home. Such role reversals are barely seen in the very patriarchal India.
Ki and Ka speaks of a similar story where Kareena Kapoor wears the ‘pants’ in the relationship while her lover Arjun Kapoor is content handling the house.

The just released trailer is what one could term as a fun watch. It is simple, the lead pair are delectable to watch and the comic situations and lines are entertaining without suffering from the usual over the top malaise.

As always, R. Balki has directed a concept not quite explored in Indian cinema. The love story spun between Kareena and Arjun is skilfully woven through role reversals. From displaying Arjun chopping vegetables to him shying away from sex citing exhaustion even as Kareena demands it (of course Arjun finally gives in), Ki and Ka beautifully packs all things needed for an entertaining watch.

While Kareena is her natural self in the movie and easily plays the man of the house, Arjun too seems have slipped in well into the role of the subdued house husband.
The movie is also replete with kisses between the lead pair which fortunately hasn’t been edited out by the censor board.
It remains to be seen how effectively Balki will convey the message of both genders -male and female- being equal and no job especially housework being gender specific.
