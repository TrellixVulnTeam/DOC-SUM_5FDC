Senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan today said Shiv Sena may break off its ruling alliance with BJP in Maharashtra before next year’s civic polls in Mumbai and other cities of the state.
“The coalition of BJP and Shiv Sena is full of contradictions and the kind of spat the two parties are having is evidence of the same,” the former Maharashtra Chief Minister told reporters here.
“As a politician, it is my reading that before the civic body polls in Mumbai and other parts of the state, Shiv Sena may withdraw their support and pull out from the (state) government,” Chavan, a former Union Minister, said.

“Once, Shiv Sena withdraws the support, the government will automatically go into a minority and further political developments will take place,” he added.
Recently, the ruling alliance partners had locked horns with each other over an article in BJP’s fortnightly magazine ‘Manogat’. The article had dared the Sena to take “divorce” while enumerating the sacrifices the saffron party has made in the past to keep the alliance intact.
