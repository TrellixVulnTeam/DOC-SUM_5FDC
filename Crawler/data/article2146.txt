Music maestro A. R. Rahman on Monday clarified that he is yet to be approached with the offer of becoming the Goodwill Ambassador for the Indian contingent at the Rio Olympics. While it was earlier reported that the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) had approached Rahman after their decision of appointing Salman Khan as the Goodwill Ambassador drew flak, Rahman said that he had heard about it only from the press and not officially. Later, IOA had announced Sachin Tendulkar as Ambassador in a bid to save face.
Speaking at trailer launch of ‘Pele: Birth of a legend’, a movie for which he has scored the music, Rahman when asked about becoming the Goodwill Ambassador for India at Rio Olympics said, “I heard it from the press but nobody has approached me. It was all over the press and in the Google news spread. But I didn’t get any email yet. Maybe my management knows.”
Rahman however didn’t mention if he would take up the post if official offered.
The music legend also defended Salman’s appointment and said, “I think he is a very popular face. So why not have him.”
