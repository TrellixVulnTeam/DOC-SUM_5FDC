DANISH AND Sartaj, sons of Mohammed Akhlaq, who was lynched by a mob at Dadri in September over rumours of beef consumption, on Sunday met Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and expressed satisfaction over the ongoing investigation.
Danish, who was critically injured during the attack, has recently been discharged from the hospital. The state government on Sunday said that his family members, who have already been given Rs 45 lakh as financial help, are satisfied with the steps taken and did not want “any further investigation”.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Samajwadi Party MLC Ashu Malik, who brought the family to Lucknow to meet Akhilesh, said: “They are satisfied with the ongoing investigation and wanted to thank the CM for the help that has been provided to them.”
Asked about the state government’s promise that the family will be provided flats in Noida, Malik said: “No such discussion took place, as it is expected that it would soon be handed over to them.” Later in the day, Akhilesh also provided Rs 20 lakh to the family of police constable Azmat, who had died from wrong treatment in October. He was posted in Bulandshahr district.
