Indore, Aug 5 (PTI) In a veiled attack on Pakistan, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat today said the neighbouring country hates India so much that it was ready to let itself down in order to harm India.
"There is so much hatred: 'our (Pakistan's) own condition is quite bad, but we (Pakistan) would let ourselves down to spite the neighbour (India).' This is how our neighbour is behaving," Bhagwat said while speaking at a book-launch here.
"Whenever we extend the hand of friendship, it (Pakistan) makes such circumstances that we can not offer friendship again," he said.
He also said that both developed and developing countries were getting caught in the crossfire as the tussle to become superpower was on in the world.
"Global thinkers are wondering if the race to become superpower continues like this then whether the world would survive. The world is looking at India with hope for answers. If we are able to answer these questions then we can become the number one country," Bhagwat said.
Hindi translation of Vijay Deshmukh-written biography of King Shivaji, "Shakkarte Shivrai", was launched on this occasion.
Bhagwat said during Shivaji's times words such as "communalism" and "secularism" were non-existent, yet he, as a ruler, treated everybody equally.
