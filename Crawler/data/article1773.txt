Actor Leonardo DiCaprio has been termed hypocrite by many for taking a private jet to collect an environmental award in New York.
A representative for the 41-year-old “Revenant” star has responded to the criticism, saying he only hitched “a ride with flights that were already planned,” reported Aceshowbiz.


“He was asked to speak at both Riverkeeper and amfAR events, but the only way to attend the two fundraisers was to hitch a ride with flights that were already planned. Leo helped both events raise millions, donated his own funds, auctioned off his house and had speaking roles in both programs,” his rep said.
During the amfAR Gala at the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc on Thursday, May 19 in Cap d’Antibes, DiCaprio auctioned off a one-week vacation at his home. The lucky winner would stay in his Palm Springs residence but he wouldn’t be there.
