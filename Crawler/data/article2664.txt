WITH A week left to prove majority on the floor of the House, the newly appointed Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Kalikho Pul, Sunday said that “at least a dozen” Congress MLAs from the Nabam Tuki camp were ready to shift their allegiance in a couple of days.
The rebel Congress leader, who at present has the support of 19 of 45 Congress MLAs, is confident of winning the floor test in the 60-member House.
“I may have only 19 out of the 45 Congress MLAs on my side now. While Likha Saya has joined me, 12 more are in touch and will come over in a couple of days. Otherwise also, I can win the floor test because 11 BJP and two Independent MLAs have pledged their support to me,” Pul told The Indian Express.
Pul was sworn-in on Friday night, a day after the Supreme Court vacated its interim order of maintaining status quo in the Arunachal Assembly.
Though the state unit of the Congress has declared that none of the dissident MLAs were with the party any more, Pul claimed that his government was an “all-party government led by the Congress”. “Ours is an all-party government like in Nagaland. This is a government led by the Congress with outside support of the BJP. There is no question of joining the BJP. But if they support our government, it is only good for our state,” he added.
He denied any “BJP machination” behind installing him as the CM. “We are all in Congress and will remain with it,” he added.
