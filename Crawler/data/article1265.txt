Kolkata, Jun 28 (PTI) Kerala has backed out of its commitment to support the Goods and Services Tax (GST) bill, Chairman of the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers Amit Mitra said today.
"Finance Minister of Kerala Thomas Issac had supported the bill in the recent meeting held in the city, but now they said they were trying to arrive at a consensus," Mitra, who is also the West Bengal's finance minister told the State Assembly.
Speaking to reporters outside the House, he said that looking for consensus meant things were in 'doldrums'.
He alleged that there was a state of complete contradiction and confusion in the Left Front on the issue.
In the June 14 meeting of the empowered committee of the state finance ministers, all states except Tamil Nadu had agreed to support the GST Bill.
