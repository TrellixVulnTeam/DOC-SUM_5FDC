“Apparently they have no intention of whatsoever of proceeding against them because they look upon them as their national assets,” Sehgal told ANI.
“They were sponsored by them, fully armed by them, fully instigated by them and hence they are reluctant to take any action against them, despite national or international pressure,” he added.
