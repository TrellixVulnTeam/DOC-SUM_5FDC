SC scraps PIL on Rahul Gandhi's citizenship ||||
 The Supreme Court on Monday scrapped a PIL seeking a CBI probe into Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi's citizenship. The court said PILs cannot be individual-centric and that the petitioner had made allegations without verifying facts. BJP leader Subramanian Swamy had claimed earlier that Rahul Gandhi declared he was a British national when he had worked in the United Kingdom. ||||

The Supreme Court on Monday discarded a PIL seeking a CBI probe into Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s citizenship.
A bench comprising Chief Justice H L Dattu and Justice Amitava Roy questioned the “authenticity of the document” attached with the PIL and the manner in which the papers were procured.
“Can we start making roving inquiries,” the bench asked while turning the petition as “frivolous”.
BJP leader Subramanian Swamy, a couple of weeks ago, had alleged that Rahul Gandhi had declared himself a British national in documents before the company law authorities in the United Kingdom, where Rahul was working briefly.
He further wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanding that the Congress MP be stripped of his Indian citizenship as well as his parliamentary membership.

The Congress had, however, rejected the allegations of nationality against Rahul saying that it is a “bunch of falsehood”.
