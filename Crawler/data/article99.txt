Azam will see truth if his own kin are raped: BJP ||||
 Uttar Pradesh BJP spokesperson IP Singh on Wednesday said that Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan will realise the seriousness of the Bulandshahr gangrape incident if his own daughter and wife are gangraped. The comment comes after Khan earlier called the incident a political conspiracy by the opposition to defame the Uttar Pradesh government. ||||

The political slugfest over the gangrape of a woman and her teen daughter in Bulandshahr hit a new low Wednesday as a senior BJP leader attacked Uttar Pradesh minister Azam Khan, saying that the Samajwadi Party leader would feel the intensity of the incident only if his “wife and daughter were gangraped”.
“Miyan Azam Khan ke beti aur bibi se gang-rape ho jaye tab Azam ki aankh khulegi Bulandshahr highway par 12 saal ki beti aur maa ke saath gang-rape par ochhi baat kahi…” (Azam Khan’s will see the truth if his daughter and wife are gangraped. He has made absurd comments on the gangrape of a 12-year-old girl and her mother),” state BJP spokesperson I P Singh said in a tweet.
Singh was reacting to Khan’s controversial statement two days ago, suggesting that the gangrape could be an outcome of a conspiracy against the ruling SP.
When contacted, Singh stood by his remarks. “I am deeply pained with the statement that Azam gave on the Bulandshahr gangrape. I will not remove my tweet until Azam tenders apology for his remark,” Singh said. He claimed that the tweet was his personal view and not of the BJP.
Reacting to Singh’s comments, Khan said: “This is the culture of the BJP…. Bulandshahr incident is condemnable and strict action is needed in the case.”
