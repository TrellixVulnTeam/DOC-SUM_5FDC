New Delhi, Jul 12 (PTI) Leader of Opposition in Delhi Assembly Vijender Gupta has claimed to have received a threat to his life on the mobile phone of his personal assistant following which a police case has been registered.
The complainant, Ashish Katyal, said he had received the threat call on the evening of July 10 and the caller claimed that Gupta had escaped two times but he would not be able to escape the next time even if he enhances his security.
A case has been registered at Prashant Vihar police station regarding the alleged threat to life of Gupta and a team is working on the case, a senior police officer said.
Gupta said he had received similar threat calls on June 9 and another one and half years ago and alleged that AAP was involved.
"I am 100 per cent sure Aam Aadmi Party is involved in it since I am exposing corruption of its government in Delhi. No amount of threats will stop me from exposing corrupt AAP government," he said.
AAP refuted Gupta's allegation saying his party BJP has all the probe agencies under its government at the Centre that should find out the truth.
