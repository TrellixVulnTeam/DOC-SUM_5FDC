With a group of MPs demanding changes in the Home Ministry’s decision on bringing NGOs under the Lokpal Act, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Monday assured them that the last date for disclosure of assets and liabilities of the trustees will be extended from July 31.
According to CPI member D Raja, who was a part of the delegation, Modi told the MPs that he would ask the Home Ministry to extend the date.
The ministry had issued a notification on June 24 stating that all trustees and officials of NGOs that get Rs 10 lakh as foreign contribution, and more than Rs 1 crore from the government, should disclose assets and liabilities of themselves, their spouse and dependent children; and if the NGOs failed to do so, it could lead to criminal prosecution.
