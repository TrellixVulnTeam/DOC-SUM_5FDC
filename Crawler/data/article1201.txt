Iftar is being celebrated all across the country, with the holy month of Ramadan coming to an end. But, this time, the attention was garnered by the Iftar celebrations organized in Srinagar, which became a grand affair.
On Thursday, the Valley organized its largest Iftar with 3000 people breaking their fast together on Thursday.
The event was organized by event management group, LoudBeetle.in, which had last year hosted Asia’s longest Iftar on the banks of world famous Dal Lake. There was no guest list for Srinagar’s Iftar- the invitation was sent to all.

Iftar is the sunset meal at which Muslims break their fast during the month of Ramzan. Traditionally, the meal is supposed to be taken in a congregation. It is a belief in Islam that serving food to people during Iftar brings pleasure to ‘Allah’.
In the tension fraught Kashmir valley, social gatherings such as this can help in bringing a new environment for the people to get-together and celebrate joyous occasions.
“Holy month of Ramzan is known for the festivals. So we are trying to send across a message of brotherhood by hosting Kashmir’s largest Iftar”, said Ahmer Khan, Organizer of the function.
A local, Irfan Aziz said that such events send a message of brotherhood in the society.
Last year, Alexandria in Egypt broke the Guinness Book of World Records for the longest Iftar spread by hosting 7,000 people.
India was also on the record map for organising Asia’s largest Iftar in Kashmir – along the banks of the scenic Dal Lake where more than 3,500 people formed a 5,000-feet-long chain over ‘dastarkhans’ or dinning cloth to break their fast.
