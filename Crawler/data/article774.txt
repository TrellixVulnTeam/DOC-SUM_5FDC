The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to stay the ordinance against NEET allowing states to conduct separate entrance test for admissions to MBBS, BDS courses for 2016-17.
The apex court, however, expressed its displeasure at the government over the NEET ordinance and refused to interfere in the matter for now.
“We are not interfering as it will create more chaos,” observed the apex court on the plea challenging NEET ordinance.

Hearing the plea, Justice Dave told the Centre: “What you (Centre) have done is not in good taste. It shouldn’t have been done after SC verdict. Why did you (Centre) do this? This isn’t proper.”
The ordinance deferred by a year the Supreme Court order to conduct the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) from 2016.
The govt had initially accepted the court’s order but later partially reversed it through the ordinance.
