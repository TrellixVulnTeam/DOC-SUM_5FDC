LOK SABHA MP from Hyderabad and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, who had recently faced flak for offering legal aid to the youths arrested in the city for suspected links with the Islamic State (IS), has called the IS “dogs of hell” and appealed Muslim youths not to “follow or watch ISIS activities”.
“They are spreading so much hatred…they put a 12-year-old girl for auction online. This is not about Muslim or non-Muslim. Just think for a moment what you will feel in your heart if it was your daughter. The ISIS are dogs of hell, they are cruel,’’ Owaisi said in an address to party workers at a function after Eid celebrations here Friday.
He said: “I appeal all of you youngsters not to watch the dreadful videos of ISIS. Using technology, the government is also watching those who take interest in ISIS…. You don’t need to watch ISIS.
“I tell you, do not die for Islam but live for it and humanity. Let us live like true Muslims and strengthen humanity. You youngsters should use your talent and skills to strengthen humanity and our dear country — let us strengthen it. This country does not belong to the RSS or the BJP, or Asaduddin Owaisi. It belongs to all Hindustanis.”
He also said, “If you feel like waging jihad, then instead of taking up arms, feed the poor and work for the development of people.”
Referring to the terror attack outside a mosque in Medina, Saudi Arabia, Owaisi said the attack on the Prophet’s mosque was the handiwork of enemies of Islam. “The Islamic State is demonising Muslims and Islam with their activities. They are dogs of hell.”
