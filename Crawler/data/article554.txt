THE NATIONAL Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) has indicted the Gujarat state administration for being a mute witness to the recent incident of flogging of seven members of a Dalit family for skinning a dead cow in Una town of Gujarat thus “compounding the atrocity”.
In its interim report, the NCSC said: “The police personnel were witness to the whole incident and took no timely action to stop the same. This is a clear case of negligence towards performance of duty by the police personnel leading to compounding of the atrocity.”
It recommended “strict disciplinary action” as well as action under Section 4 of the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015 against the police personnel. It has directed Gujarat’s DGP to submit a detailed report on the action taken.
“The video shows 30 to 35 people involved in thrashing the Dalit youth while policemen are standing and watching. Under section 4 of the Act, action has to be taken against them for deliberately ignoring the incident,” said P L Punia, NCSC chairperson and Rajya Sabha member from Congress. He said the amended Act also provides for enhanced payment of compensation to the victims and an exclusive court and public prosecutor for hearing the case.

The report was compiled following a site visit by NCSC member Raju Parmar earlier this week where he met several officials and the victims.
