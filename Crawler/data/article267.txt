India opener Murali Vijay has been ruled out of the second Test against the West Indies to be played at Sabina Park from Saturday. The right-hander has been ruled out due to a thumb injury.
Vijay, who had scored seven runs in the first innings of the first Test, was injured while batting. A rising delivery from Shannon Gabriel hit Vijay’s thumb as he was trying to fend it off. He did even field for some time after being hit.
With the opener’s spot available, KL Rahul is to most likely to replace him in the side. Shikhar Dhawan will continue to bar as an opener.
Vijay has 38 Test and 2637 runs to his name with an average of 40.56 with six centuries and twelve fifties. India count on Vijay’s experience but now he will be on the sidelines.
