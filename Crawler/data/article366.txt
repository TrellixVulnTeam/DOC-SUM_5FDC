Union Ministers Venkaiah Naidu and Manohar Parrikar unveiled a life-size statue of Dr APJ Abdul Kalam at Peikarumbu, his burial site in Rameswaram Island on Wednesday. Today is the first death anniversary of the former president and the Ministry of Defence has planned a host of events.
An exhibition named “Mission of Life” depicting the life of Kalam and his achievements towards nation building is set to be inaugurated.
Dr. Kalam passed away on July 27, last year while delivering a lecture at the IIM-Shillong in Meghalaya. He suffered a massive cardiac arrest. IIM-Shillong will organise a lecture series on making the world a better planet.
In the lecture series, eminent personalities from different spheres would be invited to share their experience, a spokesperson of the institute said on Tuesday.
The first lecture of the series would be delivered at the commemoration event on Tuesday, by Manas K Mandal, Director General – Life Sciences, DRDO. The lecture series will be the latest initiative by the institute amongst others.
Institute director Amitabha De said, “Dr Kalam’s legacy is to make the planet more livable, not only for the present, but for future generations as well. To pay our respects to the legend, we would name the auditorium in our new campus after the former president with a life-size statue of him to be placed outside it.”
Kalam, widely known as the People’s President, was awarded the Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian honour in 1997.
