It seems that the time that Tiger took after making his debut film “Heropanti” in 2014, is totally worth.

IndianExpress critic Shubhra Gupta wrote in her review: “It is the money shot of the film. Whenever we see Tiger doing something that involves his hands, legs, torso, head, all moving in perfect sync, scything up, slashing down, revolving on the balls of his feet, we are watching: it is a pleasure to see this young actor move, no jerk, all flow. When he is in action, that is. When he is ‘acting’, he is still clearly a novice.”
About Shraddha, Shubhra wrote: Shraddha Kapoor is slender and pretty and executes both the ‘chham chham’ in the rain as well as some roundhouse kicks and punches well enough, but is fashioned like a Bollywood heroine belonging to the potboilers of the 70s and 80s. She isn’t dragged by the hair like the leading lady of ‘Heropanti’, Tiger’s debut (also directed by Sabbir Khan) but does everything else – simper, smile, and squeal in the villain’s den.
