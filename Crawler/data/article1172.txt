Shah Rukh Khan, the ‘Badshah’ of Bollywood, feels that it is his stardom that splashed his daughter Suhana’s bikini-clad snap all over the Internet, hence, he wants to protect her from himself.
In a recent interview with Huffington Post India, the 50-year-old actor opened up about how he and the family dealt with this incident.
“She was in a bikini, she was on a beach, and she was with her little brother. You went ahead and wrote a headline, “SRK’s daughter flaunts her body.” Is it a little cheap? Maybe I felt it was,” said the ‘Dilwale’ actor.
SRK further said that he reached out to the website to get the matter under control.
“My daughter was a little awkward about it. She’s 16, yaar. And the headlines some sites use are… wow. We’re very liberal people and even had a laugh about it. But it’s still awkward,” he continued.
“I wasn’t protecting her from the media — I was protecting her from me. It’s my stardom that was the reason that picture made it to the news — it wouldn’t have if she wasn’t SRK’s daughter. There could be someone running naked and that wouldn’t be news,” added the father of three.
