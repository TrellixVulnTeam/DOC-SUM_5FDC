AN INDIAN Air Force (IAF) official has been arrested by the Delhi Police for allegedly passing on information to intelligence operatives suspected to be backed by Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI).
Ranjith K K, a leading aircraftman, was arrested from the Air Force Station in Bathinda Monday, in a joint operation by the Delhi Police Crime Branch, Military Intelligence and Air Force Liaison Unit. Soon after his arrest, he was dismissed from service and brought to Delhi, sources said.
JCP Ravindra Yadav said Ranjith was lured over the internet. According to sources, Ranjith received voice over internet protocol (VOIP)-based calls on his cellphone in which the other party, a woman with a British accent, introduced herself as Damini McNaught, an executive of a news magazine.

“Ranjith was deceived by a cyber entity called Damini McNaught, who said she was working with a UK-based media firm and that they required IAF-related information for their news magazine in exchange for pecuniary benefits. Ranjith passed on information pertaining to a recent IAF exercise, movement of aircraft and deployment of IAF units. In return, he received monetary benefits in his bank account,” said Yadav.
The police claimed to have recovered some classified documents from Ranjith, who has been booked under the Official Secrets Act.
Yadav said they had information that some serving defence personnel were being lured into an espionage network through the social media. Probes reveal that fictitious accounts were being made to identify, befriend and lure the defence personnel into revealing information, sources said.
