Vijender Singh might have won the WBO Asia Pacific Super Middleweight title, but he failed to evade controversies. Soon after the win over Kerry Hope, Vijender was accused of disrespecting the National flag.
Just two days after the momentous win in New Delhi, Ulhas PR, a resident of Vasundhara Enclave, entangled Singh’s name in the debate after he was seen wearing tri-colour shorts on Sunday’s event. Ulhas has also registered a complaint with the New Ashok Nagar Police station.
“In this match, boxer Vijender Singh was wearing a pair of shorts and on the back of it India’s national flag was placed. This is a clear violation of flag code of India,” Ulhas was quoted as saying.
