Vidya Balan openly expressed her admiration for actress Kangana Ranaut for standing up for herself against Hrithik Roshan single handedly.
When asked by Indian Express.com about Kangana’s fighting spirit, Vidya said, “I really think it is none of my business to be judging anyone but I have the greatest admiration for Kangana Ranaut because she is standing up for herself.”


Elaborating on why she loves Kangana’s fighting spirit, Vidya said, “I think that it is very creditable because as woman we find it very easy to stand up for other people, our family members, our children, our husbands, parents but we rarely stand for ourselves. And she is standing up for herself so kudos to her and more power to her for that.”
Kangana and Hrithik have been involved in a bitter legal spat and both parties have show little indications of slowing down or reaching a truce. Last week, cyber cell cops recorded Kangana’s statement in connection to the email transcripts exchanged between herself and Hrithik.
