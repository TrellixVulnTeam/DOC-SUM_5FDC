Joining him in the protest were Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad and Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge among others. In October, Singh had allegedly made derogatory remarks about Dalits. ||||

Changing its strategy, the Congress party on Monday held protest outside the Parliament against Union Minister General V K Singh for his ‘insensitive’ remarks on Dalits’ deaths in Haryana.
Party vice-president Rahul Gandhi and senior leaders including Ghulam Nabi Azad and Mallikarjun Kharge shouted slogans before TV cameras in front of the main entrance of the Lok Sabha and not inside the House.
The Congress move looked more like ‘token protest’ before TV cameras. Non-Congress parties took it as a signal that the Goods and Services Tax (GST) bill is set to pass now.
However, by 3 pm the Congress leaders were looking worried as the news of the Delhi High Court judgment came that dismissed Rahul and Sonia Gandhi’s contention that summons issued to them by the lower court in the National Herald case is illegal. The Congress has an option to go to the apex court or face the lower court’s summons.
The summons were issued on a criminal complaint lodged by BJP leader Subramanian Swamy for alleged cheating and misappropriation of funds in acquiring ownership of now-defunct daily the National Herald.
The unexpected decision of the court came at inappropriate time for Congress. It will strengthen the government’s efforts to form consensus to pass the GST.
The Congress is likely to accept cap of 18 per cent after the recommendation came from committee of the Ministry of Finance.
