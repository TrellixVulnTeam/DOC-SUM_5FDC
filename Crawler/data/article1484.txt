The Country’s first “sunken museum”, with live demonstrations of building crafts, is set to come up at the World Heritage Site of Humayun’s Tomb. Slated to be open to the public by early 2018, the interactive museum will display a mix of artifacts that have been locked up in the reserve collections of the National Museum, National Archives and museums of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).
The roof of the gallery was laid down this week. As of now, 30 per cent of the work has been completed, said officials.
The museum-cum-interpretation center was conceptualised in 2010 by the ASI. Following several studies to determine an appropriate site, construction began in April last year.
Officials said the original gold finial, that fell from the 16th century monument during a sandstorm in May 2014, will be the centerpiece of the finial gallery.
A live demonstration of building crafts such as stonework, tile work and other prominent Mughal crafts will be a permanent activity at the museum. “The museum will focus on bringing alive the seven centuries of pluralistic cultural traditions and architectural history of the Nizamuddin area,” said Ratish Nanda, CEO, Agha Khan Trust for Culture.
