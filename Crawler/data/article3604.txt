According to a preliminary report released by Swiss Re, the total economic losses from disasters is expected to reach $85 billion by the end of 2015. Of that total economic losses incurred, natural catastrophes have caused $74 billion in losses and man-made disasters, the remaining $11 billion. It says, approximately 26,000 people died in disaster events in 2015, double the amount from 2014.
Meanwhile, the insured losses from disaster events was estimated at $32 billion in 2015 from $35 billion in 2014.
However, the economic losses of $85 billion are much lower than the $113 billion in 2014 and the previous 10-year average of $192 billion, says the report.

It also estimates Asia to be the most severely hit continent by both man-made and natural disasters in 2015: The Nepal earthquake (7.8 magnitude), the Tianjin port explosions in China — the worst in loss in the year and biggest man-made insured loss ever in Asia — and the Chennai floods in India.

While man-made disasters triggered $9 billion in overall insurance losses in 2015, up from $7 billion in 2014. The costliest event this year was the series of explosions at the storage facility in the Chinese port on August 12.
The China port explosions is said to have claimed 173 lives and injured many more, as well as damaging and destroying vehicles, shipping containers, production facilities and surrounding property. From the report, the initial indications suggest claims of at least $2 billion. Fires and explosions at other industrial sites and energy facilities in different regions added around $3 billion to the overall man-made insured tally.
In fact, natural disasters have too made quite a dent to the economies across the globe this year. The report estimates that the Nepal disaster in April claimed more than 9,000 lives and destroyed approximately 5,00,000 houses. It says the economic losses are estimated to be $6 billion, of which only around $160 million are insured, owing to the country’s low insurance penetration.

Overall, about $23 billion of loss has been triggered by natural disasters, down from $28 billion in 2014. It is also reported to be below the annual average of $55 billion for the previous 10 years of natural catastrophe insured losses.
In India, the commerce body ASSOCHAM has estimated a total revenue loss of approximately $2.3 billion from the November floods in Chennai.
Climate change has also impacted globally. According to World Meteorological Organisation, 2015 is likely to pass as the warmest year on record. This extreme temperature upsurge has led to drought, heatwaves and wildfires across the globe.

The Swiss Re report also says that more than 5,000 people died in heatwaves throughout the summer in India, Pakistan, Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. In India and Pakistan, temperatures soared to above 48°C in May and June, the highest recorded since 1995, claiming over 3,000 victims. With the landmark UN climate accord setting a new target to limit the rise in global temperatures below 1.5°C, we can only hope for a better and swift response to combat global warming.
