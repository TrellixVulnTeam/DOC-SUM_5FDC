Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi is ‘still a child’ after the latter’s purported remarks on the slum demolition drive in the national capital.
Gandhi was quoted by ANI saying, “Why is AAP doing dharna? They are in power in Delhi.”
“I think his (Rahul Gandhi’s) party has not told him that the Railways comes under the Centre, and not under the Delhi government,” Kejriwal explained on Twitter.
Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party has given request for an adjournment notice in Parliament over the demolition on Saturday in Shakur Basti in Delhi by railway authorities that rendered hundreds homeless. The government said the razing of the jhuggis came at a time when severe cold weather has set in Delhi.
The AAP government has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the matter.
The demolition drive is likely to stall proceedings in Parliament, already under severe deadlock under the duress of the National Herald case. The Trinamool Congress has also supported the AAP cause.
