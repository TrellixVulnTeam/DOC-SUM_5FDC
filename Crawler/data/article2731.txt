JNUSU President Kanhaiya Kumar, arrested on sedition charges, today moved the Supreme Court for bail which it will hear on Friday. His bail petition was mentioned before a bench of justices J Chelameswar and A M Sapre by senior advocate Soli J Sorabjee and Raju Ramachandran who wanted it to be heard today itself.
However, when the bench suggested that they would consider it tomorrow, they agreed. Kumar said in his petition that there was no need for his custodial interrogation as he has already been sent to judicial custody.
