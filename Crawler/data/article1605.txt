BJP slams Karunanidhi over anti-Sanskrit remark ||||
 BJP leader L Ganesan on Friday slammed DMK leader M Karunanidhi saying that those who did not accept Shiva, should not talk about Sanskrit since the language was born from Lord Shiva's "Udukkai" (drum). Notably, Karunanidhi had recently said, "We will not allow domination of Sanskrit not only in Tamil Nadu, but in any State. We will chase it away." ||||

Madurai, Jun 17 (PTI) BJP today slammed DMK chief M Karunanidhi for his reported remarks that there was an attempt to impose Sanskrit with the support of the ruling party at the Centre.
Asked about Karunanidhi's threat to launch an anti-Sanskrit protest on the lines of the anti-Hindi agitation, BJP leader L Ganesan said both Tamil and Sanskrit were classical languages.
Both of them were born from Lord Shiva's "Udukkai" (a type of drum). Those who did not accept Lord Shiva, should not talk about Sanskrit language, he said.
He was speaking after inaugurating the BJP's "Grievance Redressal Centre" here.
