While the course focused on language skills in its first year (2015), it was customised for the umpires by adding  language and communication skills to the curriculum.
Aspects like the language to be used (phrasing the concern or matter) to communicate to the captains/players during the game; conducting meetings and communicating to the third umpire were addressed.
The programme is made interactive by conducting role- plays, mock meetings, simulating situations and using other modes to make the course practical, BCCI explained on its website.
