If there is one thing Salman Khan can be sure of, it is relying on father Salim Khan to have his back. Forever. It hasn't even been a few days that Salim Khan faced flak for apologising on behalf of Salman for the latter's controversial 'raped woman' remark.

Now, the scriptwriter has slammed a television debate for reportedly calling his superstar son old enough to be a grandfather.
Salim took to Twitter to express his displeasure over the alleged comment, saying, people should watch Sultan before making such nasty comments about his son.
The 80-year-old writer tweeted:
In a TV debate Salman was mentioned as old enough to be a grandfather over and over. I request them to watch #Sultan in a theatre.
 
He further said that people should resist their "temptation" to hurt someone.
 
And wonder how could a man old enough to be a grandfather do this. People have strong temptation to hurt people .
but to resist this temptation will make them human which is the greatest of all religions
 
This is not the first time Salim has jumped to his 50-year-old son's rescue.
Earlier, when Salman had tweeted in support of 26/11 Mumbai attacks' accused Yakub Memon, Salim had had to apologise on his son's behalf. Khan Sr had also said back then that people shouldn't pay much attention to Salman's comments.
Salman's courted controversy recently with his remarks on how the gruelling workout schedules of his recently-released Sultan left him feeling like a 'raped woman'.
While several sections of the society, including the National Commission for Women (NCW) demanded an apology from Salman on the same, the superstar's apology is yet to arrive.
