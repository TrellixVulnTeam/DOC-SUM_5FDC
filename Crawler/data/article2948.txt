A 24-year-old woman was detained by police for breaking through barricades and throwing a flower pot on Rajpath in the heavily guarded Raisina Hill area, less than a minute before Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s convoy was to pass through.
Police said the woman, Neena Rawal, a resident of Sahibabad in UP, was released later. Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Jatin Narwal said she suffers from schizophrenia and has been undergoing treatment for the past year.
The incident took place at 2.10 pm when PM Modi’s convoy was leaving from South Block. Police said during questioning, Rawal told them she had been molested in Sahibabad.
She did not know whose convoy was going to pass through the route, added police.
Narwal said her parents were called during questioning, who told them that Rawal was disturbed. “The woman suffers from schizophrenia. No complaint has been filed by her at Sahibabad, as per local police…,” he said. Rawal’s father, Ashok, said, “She is undergoing treatment in Shakarpur.”
