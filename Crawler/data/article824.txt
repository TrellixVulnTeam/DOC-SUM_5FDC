Barpeta (Assam), Jul 12 (PTI) Four suspected jihadis have been arrested by a joint team of Indian Army and police from a village in this district, officials said today.
The four were nabbed from Rouamri Pathar village last night and some religious books and five mobile phones were seized from them, the officials said.
They have been taken to Nalbari Army camp for interrogation and further investigation and have not been handed over to police yet, they said.
Meanwhile, their family members have claimed that the four were innocent and demanded their immediate release.
Assam DGP Mukesh Sahay had yesterday said state police was maintaining "high alert" and had appealed to people not to panic over reports of "some jihadis" entering the state from Bangladesh.
He had said those reports were "uncorroborated" and "unverified" and Assam Police was investigating them and that the force and other intelligence agencies are in "full control" of the situation at present.
