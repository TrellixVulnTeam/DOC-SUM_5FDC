Nargis Fakhri is still working in Bollywood or has she left the industry forever and went back home to the US? Last few days, all that anyone could talk about was Nargis Fakhri. While some people were insistent that Nargis left the film industry forever post a fractious heartbreak with alleged boyfriend Uday Chopra, her representative had told IndianExpress.com that Nargis was very much here.
It all started during promotions of Housefull 3 when Nargis left the promotions midway, allegedly saying that she was unwell. Buzz said she had gone to the US to meet Yash Raj scion Uday Chopra. The two were said to be dating for long and were on the cusp of getting married. However, Uday was said to have developed cold feet and called everything off. Nargis reportedly had a nervous breakdown following the development.
Nargis refused to open about the rumours but Uday had tweeted then, “I normally don’t respond to gossip, but the press has been reporting a lot of fiction disguised as fact. I would just like to clarify that Nargis and I have been and still are very close friends. The press has done a wonderful job of creating stories out of thin air and I applaud their creativity. However, these are all untrue.” He also wrote to the actress, “Hey @NargisFakhri remember when I said I don’t respond to gossip. Well, I just broke that rule. Had to do it!”
The actress also finally decided to shut the gossip down. Taking to Instagram Thursday morning, Nargis posted a poster of her upcoming film Banjo co-starring Ritiesh Deshmukh and wrote, “Looking forward to finishing my assignment in the US and being back to start promoting #Banjo in the next few weeks. #noplanstoquit #hatersgonnahate #allthesearebaselessrumours.”

Nargis has been quite active on social media of late, even tweeting to her #girlcrush Lilly Singh. Hope her statement will finally put a stop to all the gossip now.
