A court in Surajpur on Thursday ordered the registration of an FIR against the kin of Mohammad Akhlaq for alleged cow slaughter.
“Judicial Magistrate Vijay Kumar acting on application moved under 156(3) CrPC for registration of a case, has ordered investigation and lodging of an FIR of cow slaughter against Akhlaq’s family,” said D S R Tripathi, Senior Prosecution Officer.

Residents of Bishada village in Dadri had met the Gautam Budh Nagar SSP on June 5 to press their demand for registration of an FIR against Mohammad Akhlaq’s family for alleged cow slaughter, following which he had ordered a probe into the charge.
A forensic lab is reported to have said that the meat found in Akhlaq’s home was beef.
“On October 8, 2015, we had sent the copy of the complaint to SSP, DIG and other senior officials requesting that an FIR be lodged for cow slaughter against Akhlaq’s family. Then we had moved an application before the judicial magistrate’s court under CrPC 156(3) for issuing directions to police to lodge the FIR,” said advocate B R Sharma.
Sanjay Rana, the father of one of the accused, said, “The court has rightly ordered lodging of the FIR. The UP government was taking one-sided action. Now the court order has provided justice to other side too.
