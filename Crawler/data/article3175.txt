Creating more jobs just got a notch higher on the Centre’s priority list. The government has decided that all ministries will now have to reflect the “Employment Generation Potential” of each proposal they put up before the Cabinet or a Cabinet committee for approval.
In a latest communication to all Government of India secretaries, Special Secretary (Cabinet) Jai P Prakash stated that all Cabinet notes will now have to “separately” and “clearly” reflect the “Employment Generation Potential” of each proposal.
“In view of the fact that employment generation in various sectors is vital for country’s socio-economic development, this aspect has to be an important criterion for any project/scheme appraisal,” stated the special secretary’s letter, adding that “it has, therefore, been decided that henceforth all the notes for Cabinet and its Committees should separately and clearly reflect the Employment Generation Potential of each proposal”.
Following this decision, all Cabinet notes will now have to indicate the employment generation potential of a proposal in the main body of the note in a separate paragraph after the paragraph on “Financial Implications” in the Draft Cabinet Note as well as the Final Cabinet Note.
The Cabinet Secretariat has sought strict compliance of this decision on an immediate basis. The government has also modified the handbook on preparation of notes for Cabinet/Cabinet committees accordingly to include this requirement.
