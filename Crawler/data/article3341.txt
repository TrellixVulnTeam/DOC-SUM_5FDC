Stating that “jungle raj” was prevailing in Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA), former cricketer and suspended BJP MP Kirti Azad Sunday said that he had informed about all the “developments” taking place in the cricket body to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley through 200 letters and 500 e-mails.
“All the corruption took place during his (Jaitley’s) tenure. I have never named Jaitley in the scam. I have nothing personal against him. But he was informed about the developments through 200 letters and 500 e-mails,” said Azad, who was suspended from the party following his allegations about financial irregularities in the DDCA when it was headed by Jaitley.
“I have sought time to discuss the matter with the Prime Minister. When he is free, I am sure I would be able to explain everything to him,’’ Azad said.
On the disciplinary action against him, Azad said he would honour whatever decision is taken by the party.
“Nobody can deter me from fighting against corruption. I have been a sincere soldier of the party for the past 25 years. The notices I got have nothing to do with the DDCA. So, what is the anti-party activity in it,” he said.
