India’ sole rower, Dattu Bhokanal has given India a rousing start in the rowing men’s single sculls event. After a drop in the middle, Dattu picked up the pace to finish third and progress to the quarterfinals.
Dattu led the race in the opening few minutes but was eventually taken left behind by Cuba’s Angel Fournier Rodriguez. Fournier finished first followed by Mexico’s Juan Carlos.
Armyman Bhokanal finished the 2000m race with a timing of 7:21.67s behind Angel Fournier Rodriguez, who clocked 7:06.89s and Mexico’s Juan Carlos Cabrera, clocking 7:08.27s.
Bhokanal was in second place for the first 500 metres of the race but started to lag behind once the Mexican in lane 2 picked up the pace around the 700 metres mark.
The well built Cuban and the Mexican then increased their lead from the rest but Bhokanal maintained his third position although he was more than 13 seconds behind the second placed Cabrera.
Dattu Bhokanal, 24-year-old Armyman , hails from the state of Maharashtra and is the only India to participate in the sculls event.
Bhokanal’s best international achievement so far was winning a silver in men’s single sculls in the 16th Asian Rowing Championships in China last year. He won two gold medals in the 2014 National Rowing Championships and represented India at the 2014 Asian Games in China.
Bhokanal won the silver medal at the FISA Asian and Oceania Olympic qualification regatta. Rower clocked 7 mins 07.49 seconds in the 2km course.
