At a time when it’s raining babies in Bollywood, actor Saif Ali Khan also confirmed his wife, Kareena Kapoor Khan’s pregnancy. Soon the news became a trend on social media. Kareena, however, was not very pleased to know about the media speculation regarding her pregnancy and what it bodes for her career.

“I’m pregnant, not a corpse. And what maternity break? It’s the most normal thing on earth to produce a child. It is high time the media back off, and stop treating me any different than I ever was. Anybody who is bothered shouldn’t work with me… but my work goes on as is, like always. Stop making it a national casualty,” she told Hindustan Times.
She also reminded that we’re living in the year 2016 and not in 1800, but even then people probably were more civilised and normal than the media.

She added that she was fed up and her pregnancy should act like a message that marriage or having a family should have nothing to do with her career.
This isn’t the first time Kareena Kapoor Khan lashed at the media for their useless speculations. Back in 2008-2009,  when her size zero figure was the talk of the town, she had lashed at them for making a huge deal about her body.
