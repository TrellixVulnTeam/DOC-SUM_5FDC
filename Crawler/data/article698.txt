SC not to intervene in VVIP chopper scam probe ||||
 The Supreme Court on Friday denied a court-monitored investigation into the alleged roles of Congress President Sonia Gandhi and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the AgustaWestland chopper scam. However, the Centre said "nobody is above the law" and a chargesheet against the accused is likely to be filed by the CBI's Special Investigation Team this year. ||||

The Supreme Court on Friday declined to issue any direction in connection with the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam case after being informed by the Centre that a special investigation team (SIT) was already probing the matter.
A bench of Justices Dipak Misra and C Nagappan further refused to order registration of FIR against Congress president Sonia Gandhi and other leaders of the party, observing that it would be for the investigators to take a call on lodging FIRs and naming the accused.
As petitioner-in-person advocate M L Sharma claimed that an Italian court verdict had allegedly incriminated the Congress leaders for their role in the scam, the bench retorted that it could not give complete credence to the verdict by a foreign court.
Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar, representing the Centre, informed that the SIT under the CBI was working expeditiously and a chargesheet was likely to be filed in a special court by the end of 2016.
