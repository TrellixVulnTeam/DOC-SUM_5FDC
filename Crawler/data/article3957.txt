US President Barack Obama denounced America’s epidemic of gun violence on Saturday after yet another deadly shooting, saying “enough is enough.”
“We have to do something about the easy accessibility of weapons of war on our streets to people who have no business wielding them. Period. Enough is enough,” Obama said in a statement. He revealed that the shooter in Colorado Springs who killed three people and wounded nine Friday had used a military-style assault rifle.
Obama also disclosed for the first time that the man arrested for the shooting had held hostages at the family planning center from which he opened fire at people outside in an hours long standoff with police.
Obama said it was particularly sad that one day after a holiday — Thanksgiving — Americans have to comfort families who suddenly lost loves ones to gun violence.
“And yet, two days after Thanksgiving, that’s what we are forced to do again,” Obama said.
