Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti on Tuesday spoke about “pain in the heart of Kashmir” which needs to be addressed immediately by all so that the youth of the state also flourish and contribute to the growth of the nation.
In her first public rally after taking over as the first woman Chief Minister of J&K early this month, she spoke about the unrest in Muslim countries, including Pakistan, Syria and Libya.
“In Pakistan, the government is fighting against its own people… Sunni kills Shia and vice versa,” she told the rally after inauguration of Shri Vaishno Devi Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, 32 kms from Jammu.
“I am proud to live in a nation where people from different religions live in peace and harmony but there is a pain…There is a pain in heart of Kashmir and we all have to heal it together.
“We need to heal it so that the youth of Kashmir flourish like those in rest of the country,” she said at the function which was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Jammu and Kashmir Governor N N Vohra and Union and state ministers among others.
Referring to the recent killings in Handwara town of north Kashmir, she expressed hope that under the leadership of the Prime Minister, her government will be able to restore peace in the state.
She recalled her conversation with her late father Mufti Mohammed Sayeed and said when talks for alliance between PDP and BJP were going on he had told her, “I have held the hand of a person who has been made the Prime Minister of the country by crores of people.”
