“Rangoon”, a period love triangle starring Saif Ali Khan, Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut, will release on September 30.
The film, which is produced by Sajid Nadiadwala, Vishal Bhardwaj and Viacom18 Motion Pictures, will have Gulzar as the lyricist. Bhardwaj is also the director and musician behind the movie while Gulzar has written the lyrics.
Bhardwaj’s last two cinematic outings “Haider” and “Talvar”, which he produced, were critically and commercially successful.
Since both the movies released in the Gandhi Jayanti week of October 2, the makers decided to continue the tradition by opting for the Gandhi Jayanti week.
Not much is known about “Rangoon” other than that it is set during the World War II.
Kangana had called it a passionate love story.
“It is a film which is set in the 1940s during the World War II. It is about three characters and one of them is a superstar and her mentor, who she is romantically involved with. Another one is a soldier. It is about INA, independence and so many other things. It is a very passionate love story,” Kangana had said during an interview.
