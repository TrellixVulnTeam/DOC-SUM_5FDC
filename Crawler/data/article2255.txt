Former Education minister and unattached Goa legislator Atanasio alias Babush Monserrate has been booked for allegedly raping a minor girl from his assembly constituency, police source said on Wednesday.
Monserrate has however denied the accusation, claiming the FIR, which was filed against him on late Wednesday evening was a conspiracy against him.
According to a complaint filed at the Panaji police station, the minor girl has accused Monserrate of raping her on more than one occasion, after he employed her at a lifestyle store owned by him some weeks back.
“The complaint has been filed under 375 of the Indian Penal Code today,” a police official familiar with the investigation told IANS on condition of anonymity.
Monserrate said that the complaint against him was a conspiracy against him.
“I had hired this girl to work in my Hallmark store because her parents came to me to look for a job. But she stole some money from the store cash counter and I had sacked her. This complaint is false. There is no question of my getting intimate with her,” Monserrate said.
Monserrate was elected to the St. Cruz constituency on a Congress ticket, but was sacked from the party after he started hobnobbing with the Bharatiya Janata Party. He has been booked in the past for extortion. His son Rohit, was also arrested for allegedly raping a minor German girl five years back, but was later acquitted from the charge.
