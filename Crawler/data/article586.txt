Warner Bros is developing a romantic comedy based on dating app Tinder.
Worst Tinder Date Ever is a pitch from Keith Merryman and David A Newman, writers of Friends With Benefits and Think Like a Man. The plot follows a couple in Los Angeles who meet via the app and share an accident-filled date.
Itâ€™s produced by Denise Di Novi and Alison Greenspan, whose joint credits include Catwoman and The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants. They also have a revenge comedy called The Ex Games in the works.
Since 2012, Tinder has become one of the most successful dating apps in the world, registering about one billion swipes a day.
News of the project follows the announcement that Sony is developing Emojimovie: Express Yourself, a film that will take place entirely inside a smartphone featuring emojis and apps that come to life.
