New Delhi, Jun 24 (PTI) Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today alleged the Prime Minister was avenging BJP's defeat in Delhi by returning bills passed by the Delhi assembly.
"I request Modi ji with folded hands. Have a big heart. Forget the defeat in Delhi and don't take revenge on Delhiites like this," Kejriwal tweeted.
In another tweet, he said "we completed all the procedures. They have no intention to clear the bills and are creating hurdles in the functioning of the AAP government".
"Should the Centre have the right to withhold the bills? Is it the headmaster if the Delhi government? Should not the Assembly have the right to pass a bill?" he asked.
"The slogan of Modi ji is na kaam karoonga, na karne doonga (neither will I work, nor will I let others work)," Kejriwal tweeted.
As many as 14 bills passed by the Delhi assembly have been returned by the Home Ministry, saying proper procedures were not followed by the AAP government while adopting the legislations.
The bills which were returned in the last few weeks include the Janlokpal Bill 2015, the Minimum Wages (Delhi Amendment) Bill 2015, Delhi School (Verification Of Accounts and Refund of Excess Fee) Bill 2015, Delhi School Education (Amendment) Bill 2015, Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Delhi Amendment) Bill 2015 and a Bill related to working journalists.
