Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has received a threat letter purportedly from the Islamic State (IS) close on the heels of BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain receiving a similar communication. The matter has been reported to the Delhi Police’s top brass, sources said.
Naqvi’s staff received the letter at his residence C1/12 A, Pandara Park, on January 25. The letter that came by post was typed in Urdu and English and contained “abusive” words against him and the party in general, the sources said.
After receiving a similar threat letter from the terror group a week ago, Hussain had said, “I had received such threats over social media before.”
National Investigation Agency had recently arrested at least 14 IS sympathisers in a crackdown across the country.
