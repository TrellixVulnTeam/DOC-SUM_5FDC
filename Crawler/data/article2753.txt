PROTESTING against the support extended by Rahul Gandhi to JNU students, the members of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the youth wing of BJP, Tuesday got a patient card issued in the name of the Congress vice-president to get him admitted to the psychiatry department of the King George Medical University in Lucknow.
Taking serious note of the matter, the KGMU authorities have dismissed a clerk and suspended another employee for issuing the patient card.
The application for the card was filed by Abhijat Mishra, general secretary of UP unit of BJYM. Mishra said he has also filed an application at the Hazratganj police station to register an FIR against Rahul Gandhi.
Abjijat, along with other BJYM leaders, was successful in getting the patient registration card issued in the name of “45-year-old Rahul Gandhi, son of Rajeev Gandhi, residence Tughlakabad, Rai Bareli, Uttar Pradesh, India” on Tuesday. They also claimed to have got the papers to get the “patient” admitted to the psychiatry department of the KGMU.
“The concerned clerk has been dismissed and another staff person has been suspended. They were responsible for the patient registration. I have constituted an inquiry into the entire matter,” KGMU vice-chancellor Ravi Kant told The Indian Express. He said that the KGMU “is not a political institution and we have highest and equal regard for every political party and its leader”.
