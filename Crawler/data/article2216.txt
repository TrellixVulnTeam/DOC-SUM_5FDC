After their incredible run, that included nine title victories on the trot, Sania and Martina have lost to only four teams and Vania and Alla are one of them. Sania and Martina had lost to the American-Russian combine in the second round of Indian Wells but did not give them any chance on Friday, trampling them over in just 50 minutes.
The top seeds did not allow their opponents to hold their serve even once in the opening set. If the unseeded pair got
to the board, it was because the top seeds dropped serve twice.
In the second set, Sania and Martina cruised to a 4-0 lead after breaking Vania and Alla in the second and fourth
games respectively.
They will now challenge fifth seeds Caroline Garcia and Kristina Mladenovic for the title. Carolina and Kristina ousted eighth seeds Elena Vesnina and Ekaterina Makarova 6-2, 6-3 in the other semifinal.
Sania and Martina have already won titles in Sydeny, Brisbane, Australian Open and St Petersburg this season.
