A day after the Punjab government imposed a ban on the screening of comedy film “The Legend of Michael Mishra”, the Haryana government on Friday announced a similar ban in the state.
“The Haryana government has banned the screening of the film ‘The Legend of Michael Mishra’ in the state till further orders,” a Haryana government spokesman said here.
“The decision to this effect was taken in view of the reports that there was resentment among members of the Valmiki community regarding some objectionable utterances in a part of the film,” he said.
The film, released on Friday (August 5), stars Arshad Warsi, Aditi Rao Hydari and Boman Irani.
“The Haryana government had received information that certain organisations and individuals were protesting against the exhibition of this film, as the lead actor, Mr. Arshad Warsi, in a scene utters objectionable words which have the potential to outrage the religious feelings of the Valmiki community,” the spokesman said.
The ban was imposed after a committee, set up by the Haryana government, watched the film and recommended that the film’s screening be stopped.
“The committee recommended that it was essential to take necessary action in stopping the release of this film in cinema halls and multiplexes as its release could cause communal violence and damage to public and private property, causing a serious law and order situation,” he added.
The Punjab government had on Thursday announced a ban on the screening of the comedy film.
