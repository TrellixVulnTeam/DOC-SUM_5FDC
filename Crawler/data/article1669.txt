Be it Salman Khan’s physique, looks or acting prowess, Aamir Khan has said he and his wife Kiran Rao are the biggest admirers of the “Dabangg” star.
Aamir said whatever his “Andaz Apna Apna” co-star does it becomes a trend in the Hindi film industry.
Both the actors are portraying wrestlers in their upcoming films and have attained a certain body type to fit into their roles, but the 51-year-old “PK” star does not want to be compared with Salman.
“My wife and I have always been Salman’s fans. He has always had a very fit body and in fact he has been the inspiration for actors like me to have a body like him,” Aamir told reporters here.
“I have just tried to be like him in ‘Dangal’ but I don’t feel, my body is as good as him. He is the original body builder,” the actor said.
Earlier, Kiran had praised Salman’s ‘langot’ clad look in “Sultan”.
Quizzed about that, Aamir jokingly said, “Where was I?” The actor later added, “Salman is anyway a handsome actor. He looks more handsome when he is without clothes… He is a gifted human being and very charming.”
There are reports that Phantom Films is planning a sequel to filmmaker Rajkumar Santoshi’s 1994 comedy “Andaz Apna Apna”.
Aamir said though he did not have any idea about a proposed sequel but if it happens he would love to star with Salman in it.
“I don’t have any idea that whether Andaz Apna Apna sequel is happening or not and whether the makers are retaining the old cast. But if it is happening, then I would love to work with Salman again.”
