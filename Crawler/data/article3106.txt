The Gujarat government has identified around 1,500 hectare land to set up a 750 MW solar park near Radhanesda village of Vav taluka in Banaskantha district, said sources.
This will be the biggest solar park to come up in the country after the 590 MW capacity solar park, the country’s first and Asia’s largest solar park, was set up in Charnka village of Patan district in 2012.
Total budget for the latest solar park is likely to be at least around Rs 4,500 crore.
With power generation capacity of estimated 750 MW, the solar park in Banaskantha is likely to surpass the Charnka solar park in Patan in terms of capacity.
“For power generation of 1 MW, two hectare land is required and so, for this new solar park in Banaskantha district, we require around 1,500 hectare land. And that land has been identified near Radhanesda village of Vav taluka in the district,” said a government official.
“Similarly, for generation of each MW unit of solar power, we require Rs 6 crore. And so, the budget for the project is likely to be at least Rs 4,500 crore,” the officer added.
Sources in the government said that most of the identified land for this solar park is owned by the government.
The project is being executed by Gujarat Power Corporation Limited (GPCL), the nodal agency for the development of solar parks in Gujarat, in collaboration with the Union Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE).
The solar park is to come up under a Scheme for Development of Solar Parks and Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects of MNRE which was announced by the Central Government in the budget for 2014-15.
A government official said that the NDA Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi had decided to create a Green Grid of power in the country by setting Charnka-style solar parks across the country and the Banaskantha project was part of that planning.
The Solar Park at Charnka was the first solar power park in the country. According to GPCL website, the Charnka Solar Park is of 590 MW capacity spread over 5,384 acres of land.
