External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, who has proved to be an effective and hands-on minister in solving the problems of the Indian diaspora, has done it again.
After Gurpreet, a woman who was stuck in a refugee camp in Germany, pleaded for help to the Indian government through a video, Swaraj intervened on Twitter and paved the way for her rescue.
The woman, who has a eight-year-old daughter, said in a video posted on YouTube that she was ‘cheated’ by her husband’s family and brought to Germany.
After the video was intimated to Swaraj by Gurpreet’s family, the minister got her officials to get in touch with the Indian consulate in Frankfurt.
On Wednesday, Swaraj posted a picture of Gurpreet and her daughter at the Indian consulate after the latter’s rescue. Gurpreet is scheduled to reach New Delhi today in an Air India flight from Frankfurt.
In another tweet, Swaraj complimented Indian Ambassador to Germany Gurjit Singh and Consul General in Frankfurt Raveesh Kumar for helping the woman and her child.
