The United Democratic Madhesi Front on Friday said it has had enough of the “betrayal” by the government and announced more intensified course of agitation that will include burning of the amendment Bill to the Constitution which it dubbed “inadequate”.
Front coordinator Mahanth Thankur announced that its next phase will begin on Sunday. “We will not come to Kathmandu for negotiations in the future… The government must come to talk to us in Madhes (region) now,” he said.
He added that they believed the new government of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli was taking the negotiations with the protesters lightly. “The government has resorted to time-buying tactics without taking our demands seriously,” he said.
Thakur also threatened that they will fight in every forum — Parliament, street and everywhere else — and not rest until and unless they bring the government “down to its knees.”
The Front, he said, will not allow any government or official programmes including the movement of ministers in their areas, indicating there may be larger confrontation between the two sides in the near future.
The new protest programme included burning copies of the Bill, holding protest rallies and assemblies, and obstructing government representatives, including ministers and lawmakers from visiting Terai region — largely inhabited by Indian-origin Madhesis.
