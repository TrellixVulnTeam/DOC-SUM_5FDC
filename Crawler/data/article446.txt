This wasn’t the sort of day Vasanth Paul was hoping Kabali would bring. But then this model and photographer got a chance to be a real life hero which few of us can.
The Chennai resident claimed he was on way back home when he took a detour that turned out as one of the best decisions of his life. When he stopped to take a leak by a plot of empty land, he heard some cries. It turned out it was a girl, apparently drugged, was crying for help from a gang of three trying to harass her.
Paul claimed he was soon fighting a gang of three, who tried to strangle him with a rope. As the scuffle ensued, the girl managed to escape. By then an auto driver was at the spot to help Paul, giving it back to the ruffians.
Paul’s post says he did not venture to file a police complaint, but the pictures show it could have become really dangerous.
Paul, whose post has since gone viral, has a moral inspired by the situation: “Don’t be afraid to face a situation, just cos you’re alone.. if the cause is right, the world would join you right away!!!!!”
