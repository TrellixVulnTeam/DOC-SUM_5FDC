Bloodbath if I disregard discipline: Swamy ||||
 BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Friday tweeted, "People giving me unasked for advice of discipline and restraint dont realise that if I disregard discipline there would be a bloodbath." Swamy earlier said Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian should be sacked, following which FM Arun Jaitley discussed the "discipline of Indian politicians" and said the BJP does not share Swamy's view. ||||

Taking his attack to those in the Finance Ministry to a new level, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy today issued veiled threat to those asking him to follow restraint saying if he “disregarded discipline there will be a bloodbath.”
“People giving me unasked for advice of discipline and restraint don’t realise that if I disregard discipline there would be a bloodbath,” he tweeted in an obvious attack on Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.
Though he did not name Jaitley, he was obviously referring to the Minister urging him for restraint and discipline in the wake of his attacks on Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian on Wednesday and his use of the word discipline in defending Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das yesterday.

In another apparent swipe at Jaitley, whose photographs of meeting with the Bank of China Chairman Tian Guoli in Beijing in a longue suit appeared in newspapers today, Swamy asked BJP to advise ministers to wear traditional and modernised Indian cloths when abroad.
“BJP should direct our Ministers to wear traditional and modernised Indian clothes while abroad. In coat and tie they look like waiters,” Swamy said in another tweet.
Swamy has been active on Twitter over the last two-three days, attacking officials of Finance Ministry and taking swipe at Jaitley.
