Allen’s last film, Cafe Society, premiered to mostly favorable reviews on the opening night of Cannes. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw called Allen’s tribute to golden-age Hollywood “amiable, if insubstantial”. It’s set for release on 15 July in the US.
Additionally, Allen is almost near completing his first-ever television show: an untitled six-episode series he wrote and directed for Amazon starring himself, Miley Cyrus and Elaine May. It will premiere exclusively on Amazon Prime Video later this year.
The 80-year-old film-maker, who found himself once again at the center of controversy at the Cannes film festival in May, following repeated allegations from his son (Ronan Farrow) – which were firmly denied by the film-maker – that he abused his daughter Dylan Farrow.
Timerbake next appears on the big screen in DreamWork’s Trolls, while Juno Temple just recently concluded her run on HBO’s Vinyl, which was recently cancelled. Belushi heads the upcoming thriller The Whole Truth, co-starring Renee Zellweger and Keanu Reeves.
