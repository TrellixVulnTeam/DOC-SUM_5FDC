Bollywood actor Irrfan Khan landed himself in a controversy when he said that “slaughtering of a ‘Bakra’ does not mean Qurbani, the traditional practice of sacrifice by Muslims.” Irrfan even invited sharp reactions from Muslim clerics, who asked him to focus on his work instead of making his own interpretation of religious customs.
Defending his comments, Irrfan Khan on Friday, in a series of tweets, said that he is not afraid of the clerics and doesn’t live in a country governed by religious contractors (thekedars). He also clarified that for him religion is about personal introspection, source of compassion and not for stereotyping and fanaticism.
He wrote, “Pls Bhaiyon, who r upset with my statement, either u r not ready to introspect or u r in a hurry 2 reach 2 a conclusion. For me religion is abt personal introspection , it’s a source for compassion, wisdom and moderation n not for stereotyping n fanaticism. Clerics don’t scare me !! Thank God I don’t live in a country governed by religious contractors (thekedars ) #FREEDOM.”
