BAREILLY Police on Saturday detained two minor girls for allegedly shooting and sharing a video of the alleged rape of another minor girl by a youth of the same village in Shergarh police station area. The detained girls as well as the alleged victim are between the ages of 16 and 17.
The incident sparked tension in the village, and a heavy police contingent has been deployed.
The alleged victim’s cousin saw the video on the cellphone of his neighbour on Friday. He informed the ‘victim’s’ father, who lodged an FIR against the neighbourhood youth and the two girls. The charges include house trespass in order to commit offence, rape, 66A of the IT Act and POCSO Act. The youth was booked for allegedly raping the girl while the two girls face charges of filming the alleged act and circulating it.
Bareilly DIG R K S Rathore said the girls are being questioned. Efforts are on to trace the youth, he added.
ASP (Rural) Brijesh Kumar Srivastava said the girls admitted shooting the video at the ‘victim’s’ house a month ago. The police are yet to record the statement of the ‘victim’. Circle Officer, Shergarh area, Pramod Singh Yadav, said the father told the police that his daughter was raped on December 18 when she was alone in the house.
“The rape victim has so far not alleged that the youth or the girls were blackmailing her,” Yadav added.
