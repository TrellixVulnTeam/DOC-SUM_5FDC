After stipulating a new appointment process for vice chancellors, Governor Kalyan Singh on Monday issued guidelines mandating all universities in the state to install a Tricolour on campus, waving “at all times”.
The move, announced with two other guidelines, is meant to instil love for the nation among students, employees and visitors to the universities.
The Governor also asked all state universities to come up with a unique anthem, to be called “Kul Geet”.
The third guideline makes it mandatory for each university to set up a chair in the name of any one “great personality” from across the country.
The chair will be engaged in promoting research on the chosen “great personality”.
