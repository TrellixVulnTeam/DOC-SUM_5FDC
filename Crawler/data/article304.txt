Actress Sonakshi Sinha has lent her voice for a song in her upcoming film Akira. And she says going behind the mike for the movie was a “very spur of the moment thing”.
The song, a promotional video goes, has the lyrics: “Hai ranjishein tere mere darmiyaan zindagi gunjayishein samjhoton ki dur tak dikhti nahi”. It will release next week.
“The song is about rage about how she will not stay silent and will fight back. That’s the spirit of the song,” Sonakshi said in a statement.
She went on to mention that “It was actually a very spur of the moment thing and honestly all my rehearsal happened while shooting the video”.
The actress, who made her debut into singing with a new single titled Ishqoholic last year, added: “We were shooting the music video and every time I went to give a shot I would end up singing it in all my zest… Its just one of those songs! So the fox guys suggested that I should record it”.
Presented by Fox Star Studios, Akira is directed by A.R. Murugadoss, who had previously directed Sonakshi in the film Holiday, which was a success at the box office.
Akira sees Sonakshi’s character coming to Mumbai from Jodhpur, where she gets into a tiff with the goons of the college she enrolls in. The story is about her fight to come out of a case, where the college goons, a corrupt cop played by Anurag Kashyap and another played by Konkona Sen Sharma play crucial components.
The film will release on September 2.
