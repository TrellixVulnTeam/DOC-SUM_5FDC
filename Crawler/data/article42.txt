Mouma Das’ Olympic appearance was short-lived as the Indian veteran lost to higher-ranked Romanian, Daniela Dodean Monteiro, in the first round of the women’s singles table tennis competition here today.
World No.150 Das failed to put up much of a fight against her 58th-ranked opponent losing 2-11, 7-11, 7-11, 2-11.
Das had qualified for her second Olympics after making the debut in Athens 12 years ago.
Later on Saturday, Olympic debutant Manika Batra will have to produce something special to get the better of 60th-ranked Katarzyna Franc-Grzybowska.
In the men’s singles, Sharath Kamal and Soumyajit Ghosh will play their first round matches later in the day.
It is the first time that four Indian paddlers qualified for the Summer Games.
