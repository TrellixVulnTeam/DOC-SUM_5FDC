“Harry Potter” star Emma Watson says she still gets nervous walking the red carpet despite attending film premieres for more than 10 years.
The 26-year-old actress has been attending glitzy bashes ever since 2001 when she first took her starring role as Hermione Granger in “Harry Potter” and said she still fears walking in front of so many judging eyes, reported Contactmusic.
“It’s funny because obviously I’ve been doing it since I was like 10-years-old. But it doesn’t ever not feel terrifying. It’s just the level of energy and adrenaline and the amount of people and it is a lot of attention in a small place,” she said.
The brunette beauty said that she likes to “experiment” and keep fashion “fun” because premieres are another outlet for her creativity.
“I love fashion I always have. I think done right it is such a creative expression. It is really fun, I’m an actress,I love how both can transform you it has a chameleon affect.”
