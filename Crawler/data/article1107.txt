Delhi Police registered a complaint against playback singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya on Sunday evening for his “abusive” comments on Twitter allegedly targeting a woman journalist.
A non-cognizable complaint was registered after Swati Chaturvedi, a Delhi-based journalist, approached the police.
The controversy started after Chaturvedi and jantakareporter.com’s editor-in-chief Rifat Jawaid objected to a tweet by Abhijeet on the murder of an Infosys techie in Chennai. Abhijeet’s tweet had said that the murder was the result of “love jihad”. It drew a sharp reaction from Chaturvedi on Saturday. She tweeted, “Pure filth @MumbaiPolice he’s trying to forment communal riots & abuse rather obvious.

Why no action?” In a chain of comments, Chaturvedi said the murderer was a man called Ramkumar who had been arrested. Abhijeet allegedly replied with profanities.
The Mumbai police tweeted to Chaturvedi later on Saturday, “We have followed you. Please DM your contact details. Talking to you at length may help us understand the situation better.”
Chaturvedi told The Indian Express “I caught out his lies and he (Abhijeet) sexually abused me on Twitter. It is a matter of sexual harassment. Women journalists have an opinion and when we express our views, they shut us off by abuses. Enough is enough.” Abhijeet was not available for comment.
