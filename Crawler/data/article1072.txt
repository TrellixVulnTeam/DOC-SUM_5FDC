Looks like Salman Khan, the highest paid host on the Indian television, has a different pay plan this year for his stint on Colors, Bigg Boss, which is a bit humane.
Bollywood Life has quoted a source as saying, “Salman has always hiked his fee for Bigg Boss, but this time he will be taking a pay cut. He wants Colors to put a chunk of money into Being Human.” Clearly charity has become a priority for Salman now.”

But when IndianExpress.com contacted the channel they refused to confirm the details.
