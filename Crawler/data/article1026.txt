New Delhi, Jul 6(PTI) Rajendra Kumar, Principal Secretary to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, was tonight suspended by the government following his arrest by CBI in connection with a corruption case.
Since Kumar was arrested on Monday and a day later a city court remanded him to CBI custody for five days, he was suspended by the competent authority, a Home Ministry official said.
Any government servant deemed to be automatically suspended 48 hours after his or her arrest in any case, the official said.
Kumar, a 1989-batch IAS officer of UT cadre, was called along with Tarun Sharma, a Deputy Secretary in Kejriwal's office, besides three other private persons, for questioning at the CBI headquarters on Monday morning.
After being questioned for half a day, the CBI decided to place the two officers under arrest along with a close aide of Kumar, Ashok Kumar and owners of a private firm Sandeep Kumar and Dinesh Gupta.
The CBI had registered a case against Kumar and others in December last year alleging that the officer had abused his official position by "favouring a particular firm in the last few years in getting tenders of Delhi government departments".
The charges pressed by the CBI are under sections 120-B of IPC (criminal conspiracy), and 13(2), 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Criminal conspiracy, criminal misconduct etc) for allegedly favouring a private company --Endeavour Systems Pvt. Ltd.-- in bagging five contracts.
