A special screening of the recently released Dishoom has been planned for the Indian cricketers in Port of Spain. The film, directed by Rohit Dhawan, stars John Abraham and Varun Dhawan. It’s about how an Indian cricketer goes missing before a big match and two cops (John and Varun) find him.
“We are planning to screen the film for the (Indian cricket) team. The entire team has shown interest in watching the film….They have heard that cricket is shot in a realistic manner and we have dealt with cricket like a soldier,” Rohit told reporters here at the success press conference of “Dishoom”.
Indian team is in the West Indies to play a four-match test series. India is currently playing the second test, while the Port of Spain test will be fourth and final test being played between August 18-22.
The plot of the film revolves around two cops played by Varun Dhawan and John Abraham, trying to solve the mysterious disappearance of a famous Indian cricketer just before a crucial India versus Pakistan match.
John Abraham and Varun Dhawan were present at the event. “Mohinder Anarnathji is there in the film and he was happy the way cricket was shot. He sent a message to Rohit and it means a lot as someone as great as him giving thumbs-up,” Varun said.
Rohit says he will make part two if he comes across an exciting story. “It’s been just a week and people have loved the characters played by John and Varun. I have a feeling that people will welcome the two characters – Junaid Ansari (Varun) and Kabir Shergill (John) if we come back,” Rohit said.
