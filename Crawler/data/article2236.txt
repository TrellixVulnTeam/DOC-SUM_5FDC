A day after he was booked on charges of raping a minor girl, Goa MLA Babush Atanasio Monserrate was arrested by the Crime Branch on Thursday. Senior Crime Branch officials said Monserrate will be produced before a court on Friday.
The minor girl, who hails from Nepal, has alleged in her complaint that in March, a couple sent her to Monserrate for a sum of Rs 50 lakh. While she could not recollect the date, the victim alleged that she was confined from 6 pm to 11 am the next day, during which time Monserrate spiked her drink and raped her.
The girl’s statement was recorded by the Child Welfare Committee, which lodged a police complaint. Monserrate was booked under charges of rape and relevant sections under the Goa Children’s Act and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The girl has been sent to Apna Ghar, a shelter, officials said.
The MLA has denied the charges. “I have not done anything wrong. It is an attempt to frame me,” he said.
A police officer said St Cruz MLA Monserrate already has 16 cases against him, including those related to criminal intimidation and attempt to murder. He was expelled by Congress last year for alleged anti-party activities.
