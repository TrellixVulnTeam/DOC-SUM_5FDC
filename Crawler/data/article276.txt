A woman has filed a rape case against ex-Congress leader from Uttarakhand, Harak Singh Rawat, ANI reported. The matter surfaced in the national capital on Friday night with an FIR being registered against him with the Safadarjung police.
Rawat has faced similar complaints in the past. In 2014, he was booked for allegedly molesting a 30-year-old woman, also in New Delhi, as reported by IANS. While the incident happened in September 2013, he was charged only the next year. According to the police, the woman has filed a written complaint, saying Rawat misbehaved with her and touched her inappropriately, when she met him.
Harak Singh Rawat was agriculture minister in Vijay Bahuguna’s cabinet. He continued as minister when Bahuguna was succeeded by Harish Rawat. However, in May 2016, he along with 8 other Congress MLAs, rebelled against the Uttarakhand government, the rebel leaders led by former CM Vijay Bahuguna. Harak Singh Rawat was expelled from Congress. Rawat was the second most powerful MLA to have rebelled.
As a result of the rebellion, President’s rule was imposed in Uttarakhand which was only lifted in July before the floor test, in which current CM Harish Rawat was able to prove majority.
Reports say that after Harak Singh Rawat’s expulsion, he joined BJP but there has been no confirmation on that.
