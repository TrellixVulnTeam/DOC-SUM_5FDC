Activists of the Shiv Sena’s Punjab unit Tuesday stopped trucks on way to J&K and forced Muslim drivers to chant slogans of ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ and ‘Pakistan Murdabad’, saying they wanted to pay back “Kashmiri Muslims” with the “right treatment” for allegedly harassing Amarnath pilgrims.
Some drivers were reportedly beaten up for refusing to chant the slogans. The drivers were also forced to burn Pakistan’s flag.
Police initially said they had no information about the protests.
Shiva Sena’s Punjab chief Rajiv Tandon said, “What they (Kashmiri Muslims) did to Hindu pilgrims on Amarnath Yatra has been done to them. We only asked Muslim drivers to say ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ and ‘Pakistan murdabad’.”
An FIR was later registered against him under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.
