Move over Hrithik Roshan, a new desi superhero has arrived with Tiger Shroff’s A Flying Jatt. The film’s makers have revealed the motion poster of the film, with a buff-and-bearded Tiger Shroff.
A masked Tiger Shroff is seen in a completely different avatar, with a blue turban, superhero costume and a golden Khanda (a Sikh religious symbol) on his chest . From the looks of the poster, one can anticipate Shroff flying off to rescue those in distress, but probably only in Punjabi heartland.
