Chandigarh, Jul 9 (PTI) An HIV prevention, treatment and care programme for Punjab prisoners was launched here today.
Speaking at the function, Additional Secretary N S Kang said that the treatment and care for those living with HIV/AIDS inside prisons should be equivalent to the treatment and care available for the general population, an official release said.
He said National Prison HIV Strategy is being implemented in a phased manner in the country.
Earlier in the phase-1, 'HIV interventions in prison settings' project was launched in February this year in 8 north-eastern states and is now being launched for Punjab and Chandigarh prisons.
