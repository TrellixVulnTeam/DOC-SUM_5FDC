Intelligence agencies have alerted the Defence Ministry about bogus welfare organisations floated by Pakistan’s ISI that target serving and retired armed forces personnel and rope them into a spy ring. Sources said the agencies had come across some outfits based in north India which offer ex-servicemen job opportunities and financial help, but later use them to extract information.
“Some organisations floated by ISI have come under the scanner for luring ex-servicemen by promising them help in getting placements or financial aid. Later, they ask these ex-servicemen for sensitive information on defence installations. Such outfits have been identified in north India, particularly in Punjab,” said a source.
Intelligence agencies have also warned about growing number of serving or retired soldiers being arrested on charges of spying for ISI. As many as 12 such arrests have been made over the past three years. While six personnel have been arrested for spying this year, four were arrested in 2014 and two in 2013. Most recently, an IAF official was arrested from Punjab on Monday.
