Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said he will not quit in the wake of allegations that he had taken bribe from solar scam accused Saritha Nair.
A day after Nair alleged that she paid Rs 1.90 crore as bribe to the chief minister, a Vigilance court in Thrissur ordered registration of an FIR against the Congress leader.
The Kerala CM said he cannot be ousted after being humiliated with allegations. “If there is an iota of substance in the allegation, I will quit from public life,” he said, adding that more revelations can be expected from Nair.


“The bar hotel owners who lost their case in the Supreme Court are behind the allegations. They want to dethrone the government as its liquor policy had affected their business,” he added.
Earlier in the day, Nair said the CPI(M) had offered her Rs 10 crore to speak against Chandy. “It was in 2014 that the CPI (M) made the offer. But, I didn’t take it up as there was a guarantee for their promise,” she said.
