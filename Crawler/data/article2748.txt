Country-made bombs were hurled at a Seva Kendra run by the RSS and at the residence of a BJP worker at Thalassery in the district in the wee hours on Wednesday, an incident which comes after an RSS worker was hacked to death in the poll-bound state.
Police said the bombs were hurled at around 1.45 this morning.
“Only a window pane was damaged. None was injured”, police sources said about the attack at the Jaganatha Mandiram Seva Kendra run by the RSS at Temple Gate in Thalassery in the district.
A bomb was also hurled at the house of Subramaniam, a BJP worker damaging the compound wall, the sources said.
The incident comes after violence erupted in poll-bound Kerala as 27-year-old RSS worker, Sujit, was hacked to death in front of his aged parents in the district on Monday night.
While BJP had slammed CPI-M for murder of Sujit, the Marxist party has denied it, saying it was the fallout of a local incident relating to insulting a girl.
Police said the accused behind the murder have been identified and the arrests would be made soon.
