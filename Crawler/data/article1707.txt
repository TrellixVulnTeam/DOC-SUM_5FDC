Game of Thrones actor Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson aka ‘The Mountain’ who has been seen on the show quashing heads to pulp and literally beating the life out of his opponents on the show, had reasons to celebrate on Tuesday night as Iceland drew 1-1 with Portugal.
He seemed to be watching the game in the comforts of his home and posted a picture on Instagram after Iceland had equalised in the 50th minute.
Björnsson had earlier sent in a message to Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo via BBC World Service Radio by saying, “I have a message for Cristiano Ronaldo. I know you’re playing against Iceland in the first game.”
“If you dare to score against my teammates, I will find you and crush your head.”
And as it turns out, Ronaldo, who was chasing a milestone of becoming the first player to score at four separate European Championships, failed to score in the draw at St Etienne.
Iceland are making their first ever appearance in a major football tournament and they got off to an impressive start with the draw against 2004 Euro runners-up.
