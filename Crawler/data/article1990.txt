In a major development for Indian football and judiciary, world governing body FIFA has turned to Justice Mukul Mudgal, who has been appointed as deputy chairman of its governance committee.
The former Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana, who headed the IPL spot-fixing probe, said is aware of his appointment.
“I have seen it on the website though I am yet to receive an official confirmation from them. I feel honoured as it is a big thing for Indian judiciary,” Mudgal told PTI.
Mudgal, who is also involved in overseeing the conduct of international cricket matches and IPL games at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium here, hinted that he would take up the offer.
Mudgal’s engagement with the Delhi and District Cricket Association gets over after the second qualifier scheduled on May 27.
Recently, he was also roped in by the Asian Football Federation in a similar capacity and he has already had one meeting with AFC, with the second one scheduled in June.
Portuguese Luis Miguel Maduro, who is a former European Court of Justice Advocate General, will head FIFA’s governance committee.
Mudgal and Maduro will also head FIFA’s International Review Committee, which will assess all major decisions.
Mexico City hosted the 66th FIFA Congress where newly elected president Gianni Infantino moved a slew of resolutions and promised massive reforms.
