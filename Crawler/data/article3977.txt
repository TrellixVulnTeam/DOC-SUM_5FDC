A war of words erupted between Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij and Fatehabad SP Sangeeta Kalia over the police’s efforts to curb the illegal sale of liquor, prompting Vij to storm out of the room.
The incident took place on Friday in Fatehabad district, where the minister, district administration officials and police were hearing people’s grievances. An NGO raised the issue of illegal sale of liqour, alleging that complaints to the police had yielded no results.

Kalia questioned the complainant, saying he should have brought it to her notice. The complainant said he had told the concerned SHO, but the IPS officer continued to defend the police. Dissatisfied with Kalia’s explanation of their efforts, Vij asked the IPS officer to “get out”. When Kalia refused to do so, Vij stormed out of the meeting.
“Despite my repeated instructions, the police have not taken effective steps to solve the problem. When I questioned Kalia, she defended the police. She even accused the government of facilitating sale of liqour. Since she was in no mood to listen to people’s grievances and promise action, I asked her to leave the room. When she refused, I walked out. I will inform the Chief Minister about this,” Anil Vij told The Indian Express.
Kalia refused to comment. When contacted, she said, “I will not say anything on the issue. It happened in front of people and there is video footage.”
Social networking sites were abuzz with videos of the spat. The footage shows Kalia blaming the government for facilitating sale of liqour. When Vij confronts her, she clarifies, “I meant that it is the government that gives licence for sale of liqour.”
