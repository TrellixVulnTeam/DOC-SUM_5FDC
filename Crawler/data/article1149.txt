“Both of them (SP and BSP) are Rahu and Ketu for UP and have caused an eclipse on development. Lotus (BJP) should rise like the sun here to remove that eclipse,” Shah said.
“The manner in which SP government is functioning, it has no right to continue in power for a single moment,” said Shah, adding that the governments should give land to poor but SP government itself was grabbing land.
Shah said that with blessings of this government, people in Mathura kept land in their possession for two years and when the police went to get the land freed, a police officer belonging to the land of Jaunpur was martyred.
