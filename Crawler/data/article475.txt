Rajinikanth’s Kabali has shown that it is critic-proof with its massive box office collections. Even as mixed responses came in from reviewers, Kabali is smashing BO records with its collections. Shows are seeing 90 percent occupancy in south India and even Hindi shows have recorded over 50% occupancy on Kabali day 2 screening on Saturday.
With its day 1 earnings of approximately Rs 42 crore, the film is looking at over Rs 120 crore weekend business. On Friday, the film made Rs 21.5 crore in Tamil Nadu alone.
Trade Analyst Taran Adarsh tweeted the collection updates of North India market. Kabali, on its opening day, collected Rs 5.20 cr, while the film saw a growth of 19.23% on Saturday, in North India. Thus, by day 2, the film has earned Rs 11.40 cr here. Taran tweeted: #Kabali shows 19.23% growth. Fri 5.20 cr, Sat 6.20 cr. Total: ₹ 11.40 cr nett [Hindi+Tamil+Telugu]. Note: 1000 screens. NORTH INDIA markets.
“#Kabali -July 22 – Tamil Nadu Net -Rs 21.5 Cr (approx). Highest Day 1, in TN B-O history. Congrats @superstarrajini@theVcreations & @beemji,” tweeted film writer and anchor Sreedhar Pillai.
Film distributor Raj Bansal wrote, “#Kabali – All Versions Total – ₹ 42.00 Cr Appox. @superstarrajini Superb.” The collections are stupendous and trump Salman Khan’s Sultan, which earned Rs 36.54 crore on opening day.
However, the film’s producer S Thanu left everyone shocked when he claimed Kabali has eared Rs 250 crore on Friday itself.
A statement said the movie has earned Rs 100 crore from theatres in Tamil Nadu itself. “In India, the film has earned Rs 250 crore, which includes Rs 100 crore from Tamil Nadu and Rs 150 crore from places outside the state in India,” read a statement from the makers.

Since ticket prices in Tamil Nadu cannot be more than Rs 120, these figures are highly fantastical. To put it into perspective, a multiplex ticket in north India is priced anywhere between Rs 350-450 on a Friday and Salman Khan’s Sultan — which was released on 4500 screens — earned Rs 36.54 crore. Even though Kabali has released on almost double the number of screens, it ticket prices are also much lower.
