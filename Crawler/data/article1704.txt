Chandigarh, Jun 15 (PTI) A ban has been imposed on the sale of correction fluid and thinner in bottles in Haryana with the government saying strict action will be taken against those found violating the orders.
Deputy Commissioner, Executive Magistrate, Medical Officer, Senior Drugs Control Officer, Drugs Control Officer and police officers of the rank of Assistant Sub Inspector or above have been tasked to enforce the ban, state's Health Minister Anil Vij said in a press release.
The officers have been asked to send progress report on every fifth of the month through the Additional Deputy Commissioner concerned to Commissioner of Food and Drug Administration, he said.
Vij said although a notification was issued in this regard on the orders of Punjab and Haryana High Court in 2012, it did not empower any officer to enforce the ban.
The issue was discussed at a meeting of Health Department on April 21 and a decision was taken to empower the officers to take action against those found defying orders.
"Correction fluid and thinner are used as nail polish removers by women, which has toxic chemicals. These are also used in offices, but were reportedly being misused by children as intoxicating substance or drug, giving them stimulating effect like drugs on its inhalation. In order to protect them, law was amended, Vij said.
