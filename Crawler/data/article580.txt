Steven Spielberg has seen many successes in life, seen a lot of appreciation, acclaim from the world over. We might think he's lived a charmed life, but The BFG director revealed in a radio interview that was not at all true. He's seen rejection in life, and from none other than Albert 'Cubby' Broccoli, the producer of the Bond franchise.

To make matters worse, this has happened twice. The director approached 'Cubby' after Jaws became a huge hit in the year 1976. " So I called up Cubby and offered my services but he didn�??t think I was right for the part." And then karma turned around and Spielberg's 'Close Encounters of the third kind' was a giant hit for the filmmaker.
Spielberg called Mr Broccoli once more, "Once again, I tried to get on a Bond film and now they can�??t afford me," laughed the man behind great films like Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and many others.
The auteur filmmaker will see the release of his next film, an adaptation of Roald Dahl's The BFG starring Mark Rylance and Ruby Barnhill, on July 22 in India.
