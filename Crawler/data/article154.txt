NASA to probe asteroid that might hit Earth ||||
 NASA is planning to probe the asteroid Bennu which might hit the Earths surface between 2175 and 2196. Discovered in 1999, the 500-metre, 60-million-ton asteroid, which moves at a speed of over one lakh kilometre-per-hour around the sun, can cause an impact equivalent to three billion tonnes of explosives. Researchers have estimated the chance of impact at about one in 2,700. ||||

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is planning to send a probe team, to an asteroid in space, to analyse as it is expected that it might hit Earth’s surface. The NASA spacecraft, OSRIS-REx, will be launched in September this year, reports Daily Mail, and reach the asteroid’s surface in 2018 after which it will spend a year collecting rock samples and return to Earth in 2023. If the mission is successful, it would be the first time that a spacecraft would land on an asteroid and return to Earth with samples.
According to the report, the asteroid named ‘Bennu’ crosses the Earth’s orbit once in every six years and it is expected that Bennu will pass between Earth and moon in the year 2135.
Nasa scientists are worried that Bennu, which is 500-metres wide and can cause an impact similar to 3 billion tonnes of explosives, might get pulled by Earth’s gravity and change its orbit. Because of this, later in the century, Bennu can come crashing into Earth’s surface. Professor of planetary science at Arizona University, Dante Lauretta, told Daily Mail that this collision may cause “immense suffering and death.”
Reportedly, the asteroid moves at an average speed of 63,000 mps around the Sun. The mission is led by University of Arizona and the launch is scheduled on September 8 at 7:05 pm local time.
As per the report, the samples collected from this mission will also be used for other purposes like study of building blocks of life by analyzing the minerals present beneath the asteroid’s surface.
