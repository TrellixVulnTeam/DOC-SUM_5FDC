Mumbai, July 13 (PTI) Bollywood star couple Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan, who are expecting their first baby, have rubbished reports of having done a sex determination test in London.
Saif (45) married the (35) years old Kareena in 2012.
According to some media reports, the couple visited a doctor in London for a check-up and the sex determination recently.
"The report is completely baseless and the couple strongly denies any such incident. There was no such discussion with any doctor in London and the report is purely a figment of someone's imagination," spokesperson of both the actors said in a statement here.
"Kareena and Saif are both mature adults and are above all this. We would like to request everyone not to unnecessary sensationalise a private issue," the spokesperson added.
