Mumbai, July 7 (PTI) A PIL seeking a direction to the Election Commission of India to scrap 'Lotus' symbol allotted to BJP was filed in the Bombay High Court today, contending that it is a national flower and cannot be used as a party icon.
The petition alleged that BJP is using the national flower (Lotus) for electroral purposes and thereby violating the Emblems and Names (Prevention of improper use) Act 1950.
"Lotus is a sacred flower and occupies a unique position in art and mythology of ancient India and it has been an auspicious symbol of Indian culture. Lotus is a flower of Goddess Laxmi and symbolises wealth, prosperity and fertility," said the petition filed by activist Hemant Patil.
"Lotus symbolises purity, achievement, long life and good fate and hence cannot be used as a symbol by any party for election purpose," argued the petition, which is likely to come up for hearing next week.
The petitioner said he had given a representation to the Election Commission to scrap the Lotus symbol of BJP as it was a national flower but it had not been considered and hence he had moved the Bombay high court.
The Lotus symbol was allotted to BJP 25 years ago by the Election Commission but no party or person had ever objected to it, though it is violative of Emblems and Names (Prevention of improper use) Act, said the petition.
