We’re all aware of how politicians are active on Twitter in the times when social media has become an important part of people’s daily lives. For both the sides, the politicians and the people, it has proved to be a great way to communicate time and again.
Now, one may not necessarily have to go through the tedious and time-consuming process of booking an appointment with the people in power, looks like it can be done on Twitter, that is, if you are lucky – or a Bollywood star.
So, when actor Irrfan Khan wanted to meet a few politicians to ask questions “as a common man”, he decided to ask three of India’s most active Twitter-savvy politicians — Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi. Quite possibly, to interview them in connection with his upcoming film Maddari, which is a socio-political drama.
Khan took to Twitter to ask them if he could ask them a few questions as an ‘aam admi’. “Desh ka ek aam nagrik hoon. Aap se kuch sawaal pochnay the. Can I meet you,” he tweeted out to @PMO India, @ArvindKejriwal, and @OfficeofRG.
And guess what, two of them are more than happy to meet. Arvind Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi have agreed to meet the actor on Twitter itself. In fact, Kejriwal went ahead and decided on the time too.
.@irrfan_k Sure

But our Prime Minister is “currently occupied with the upcoming Parliament session” so Irrfan has been asked to send a letter following a formal process.
Desh ka ek aam nagrik hoon. Aap se kuch sawaal pochnay the. Can I meet you @PMOIndia ?
— Irrfan Madaari (@irrfan_k) July 16, 2016
@irrfan_k Currently the PM is occupied with the upcoming Parliament Session. Please send a letter with details.

However, not everyone is as lucky as Khan or as much of a ‘common man’ as him. When another Twitter user had asked the same question to Kejriwal, he didn’t get the response. At least at the time of writing. The user has even shared it on Twitter.
Desh ka ek aam nagrik hoon. Aap se kuch sawaal pochnay the. Can I meet you @ArvindKejriwal?

Khan seems to be on a politician-meeting spree. A while back, the actor did a rather hilarious interview of Bihar politician Lalu Prasad which was widely shared online as well.
