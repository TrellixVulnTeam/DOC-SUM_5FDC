Actor Colin Firth’s Harry Hart is back from the dead for Kingsman: A Golden Circle.
An image of the 55-year-old English actor was shared by Pedro Pascal on his Instagram account confirming that spy Harry was not killed in last year’s hit “Kingsman: The Secret Service.”
“Hide behind Harry. #SafePlace #Kingsman2 #TheGoldenCircle,” Pascal captioned the new picture, showing himself hiding behind Firth. Pascal, best known for his role as Oberyn Martell in “Game of Thrones,” plays newcomer Jack Daniels.
Firth’s character appeared to die in the first film, after being shot in the head by villain Richmond Valentine (Samuel L Jackson). Harry’s resurrection has been hinted at since April, when Taron Egerton tweeted a message that showed Harry’s glasses with the words, “reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.”
To be directed by Matthew Vaughn, “Kingsman: A Golden Circle,” will release on June 16, 2017.
Channing Tatum, Julianne Moore, Halle Berry and Elton John have also joined the cast.
