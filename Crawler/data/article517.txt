When asked about what it was like being the daughter of an actor in terms of privileges and perks when she entered the industry, Sonam said: “My father cut me off when I was 18… He said you want to become an adult, become an adult.
“I had to take responsibility and I did … and it is one of the best things anybody has ever done for me. You know he said that I never want to make a decision for you. I can tell you what is right or what is wrong but at the end you have to make your own decision.”
The actress, who had her share of setbacks in the industry — be it with “Saawariya” or “Mausam”, also shares that she loves her father for taking this firm decision.

The episode of the fourth season will air on Star World and Star World HD on Sunday.
About her career, the “Khoobsurat” star said that even though she aspired to be like her father, she never really wanted to be an actor initially.
She also mentioned how she would like to start a family some day, but isn’t looking to settle down any time soon.
