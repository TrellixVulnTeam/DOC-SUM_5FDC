The Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha chief Swami Chakrapani was given Z-security by the government on Wednesday after four people were arrested for planning an attack on him.
Swami was part of a five-member team of ‘seers’ which had visited Kairana to probe the ‘Hindu exodus’ matter and submitted a report to the Uttar Pradesh government.
The Hindu Mahasabha also made headlines when they set on fire the car of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim in Faridabad, Haryana in December last year.
Further details are awaited.
