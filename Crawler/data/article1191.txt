The dream of the Indian Air Force to have a squadron of the indigenous Tejas Light Combat Aircraft has been realized today, after years of delay. Two aircraft have been inducted into the IAF squadron, known as the ‘Flying Daggers 45’ at a ceremony in Bengaluru.
For the first two years, the squadron will be based in Bengaluru, after which it will move to Sulur in Tamil Nadu.
The IAF has said that the aircraft will feature quite prominently in the force’s combat plan next year and it might be deployed in forward bases as well. There are also plans to acquire over 80 aircraft with better specifications, known as Tejas 1A in the future, PTI reported.

Ten facts about the Tejas LCA

* In 1986, Rs 575 crores were allocated by the then government towards funding the programme.
* On January 4th, 2001, the light combat aircraft made its first flight, a milestone in the Indian aviation industry. Then Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee named the aircraft ‘Tejas’ – which means ‘radiance’ in Sanskrit.
