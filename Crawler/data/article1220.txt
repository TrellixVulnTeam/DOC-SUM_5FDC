When it comes to Rajinikanth, it doesn’t seem odd that a special flight be decked with the superstar’s image so that fans can be flown to see the first day, first show of Kabali in Chennai. And that is exactly what has happened.
The Tamil gangster movie, which has been written and directed by Pa Ranjith was scheduled to release on July 15, but there are reports that suggest it may be postponed to July 22. “The exact reason is still unknown but the makers are most likely to push the release by a week. The film will now release on July 22. As soon as the censor is done, the makers will officially announce the release date,” a source from the film’s unit told reporters.
This promotional activity, to creat a special aircraft, has been organised by the Malaysian carrier Air Asia, which is the official partner of the film, and keeping in-line with the same, Air Asia is working on this Kabali-themed aircraft.
