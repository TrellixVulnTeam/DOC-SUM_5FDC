Amritsar, June 19 (PTI) Private schools will not be allowed to hike fees in the middle of a session and any increase at the start of the academic year would also need to be consulted with parent-teacher associations, Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani said today.
"We have proposed to states that if private schools want to hike fees in the beginning of a session, it has to be done in consultations with parent-teacher associations, but we will not allow mid-session fee hike," Irani said.
There has been a growing resentment among parents about inordinately high private school fees, the Minister said, adding that her ministry has received several complaints regarding the issue.
The Centre has proposed this to states, Irani said, adding the Punjab government will soon take a decision on this matter.
