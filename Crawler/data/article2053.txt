BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy on Thursday said that Raghuram Rajan should be removed as RBI Governor as he was responsible for the “rise in unemployment and collapse of industry”.
“In my opinion, the RBI governor is not appropriate for the country. I do not want to speak much about him. He has hiked interest rates in the garb of controlling inflation that has damaged the country,” Swamy told mediapersons at Parliament.
He said that Rajan’s actions had “led to collapse of industry and rise of unemployment in the economy”, and “the sooner he is sent back to Chicago, the better it would be.”
“All the industries have collapsed and as a result unemployment has increased. In my opinion, he should be removed as early as possible,” he added.
