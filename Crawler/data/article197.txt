Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday said that the AAP “sold” tickets for the upcoming assembly elections.
“AAP has bid goodbye to all the democratic norms which is evident from the way the tickets for 2017 assembly elections have been announced,” he said. “The party has resorted to selling tickets which needs to be condemned by civilized society.”
Deputy CM said that as per AAP volunteers, tickets were “sold out”. Sukhbir also termed Congress as the alliance’s only competitor.
Addressing a large gathering in Samrala constituency of Ludhiana, on the occasion of distributing bicycles to girl students under Mai Bhago Vidya Scheme, the Deputy Chief Minister termed AAP as a rag-tag bunch of so called leaders assembled hastily from outside Punjab, and also said that these leaders are devoid of roots and do not have any standing amongst the common people whose cause it so loudly claims to champion. Attacking more, he said that AAP leaders have no inkling about the rich and glorious tradition of Punjab.
