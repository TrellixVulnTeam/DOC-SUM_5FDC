“Dishoom” actor Varun Dhawan and producer Sajid Nadiadwala have denied that a kirpan — a Sikh ceremonial dagger — was used in the film’s song “Sau Tarah Ke”.
At an event here, Varun was asked to comment on a complaint regarding the use of a kirpan-like dagger as an accessory on actress Jacqueline Fernandez’s short outfit.
He explained: “It’s not a kirpan. It’s an Arabic sword which has been used and we must actually be having it, so we can show it. I am a Punjabi myself, and so is my brother (director Rohit Dhawan). So we would never do something like that. It’s a misunderstanding.”
Nadiadwala said he had read the news that the Sikh community had condemned how Jacqueline is seen shaking a leg wearing a short dress with a short sword, resembling the kirpan, around her waist.
“We shot the song in Morocco. So there’s no question (of using a kirpan). Once they see the song, they will know. They saw the clipping and they thought it is a kirpan,” the producer said.
An open letter is said to have been addressed to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) demanding to remove the song from the film and from websites like YouTube. Not only that, also they asked for an apology from the makers of the film and posted the same on his Facebook wall terming Jacqueline as ‘semi-clad actress’.
Scheduled to release on July 29, the much-awaited action-comedy film is helmed by Rohit Dhawan and also features John Abraham in the lead role.
