Panaji, Jul 9 (PTI) Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar today said the country is working on manufacturing next generation of routers.
"Information is important tool and we cannot have routers which are functioning from abroad where there might be bugs to sabotage or cause leakage of vital information and data. We should have routers for at least important networking from our own creations," Parrikar told the gathering during golden jubilee celebration of Goa Engineering College here.
"We (India) are also working on (manufacturing) next generation router. It is very important in telecommunication. If you don't want your telecommunication to be leaked, then the router should be controlled by you as there is a high possibility that the routers might have trap doors," the Minister added.
"We have done that (manufacturing of routers in India). We have signed agreement with ANURAG (Advanced Numerical Research and Analysis Group) to develop second-stage router. Why can't the institute like Goa Engineering college do it?," he said.
Parrikar, a former Goa Chief Minister, also said "It is unfortunate that none of the Goa-based technical institute never thought of taking advantage that (a) Goan is a Defence Minister by proposing tie up with the organisations like DRDO."
