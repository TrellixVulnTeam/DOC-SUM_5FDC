The AAP is set to win the Punjab assembly elections, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday, adding he expected the Congress to finish a distant second.
“We are winning (in Punjab),” Kejriwal told a group of journalists at his residence here. “Delhi will be repeated in Punjab.”
He said the Congress may be the runner up in the Punjab battle. “The Akalis are in a bad shape.”
Kejriwal led the Aam Aadmi Party to a sweeping win in February last year in Delhi, where it secured 67 of the 70 seats.
He said the party now had workers in every polling booth and had started door to door campaigning all across Punjab.
“By the time others wake up, their game will be over,” he said, drawing a parallel with Delhi.
Asked who would be the AAP’s chief ministerial candidate, he replied: “We will reveal that at the right moment.”
Kejriwal, however, said his party was not looking at the next Lok Sabha elections now and would not contest the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections next year.
“We will go step by step. We don’t have the bandwidth in UP.”
