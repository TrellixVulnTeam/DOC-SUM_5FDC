Delhi Police’s Special Cell arrested an auto-rickshaw driver from Kashmere Gate ISBT on Thursday night and alleged that he has links with the Islamic State (IS).
The accused, identified as Mohsin Ibrahim Sayyed, 26, is a muezzin at a mosque in Malad, a Mumbai suburb, and had come to Delhi to meet an associate, the police claimed to have learnt after interrogation. A Delhi court on Friday remanded him in police custody till February 10.
This is the fifth arrest by the Special Cell in connection with a module of the terror outfit the police claim to have busted last month. Last month, they had arrested four persons from Uttarakhand on suspicion of links with the terror outfit and claimed to have unearthed a terror plot targeting the Ardh Kumbh in Haridwar and some “strategic locations” in the national capital.
Special Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Arvind Deep said Rs 85,000 was recovered from Mohsin Ibrahim Sayyed. “During interrogation, it has emerged that he was about to leave for Syria,” Arvind Deep said.
The police claimed that Sayyed was given Rs 1.5 lakh by a man in Lucknow, who was arrested by the NIA, and was allegedly asked to deliver it to an associate. “Sayyed, who is believed to be self-radicalised, was acting as a financier and had given Rs 50,000 to the four arrested by Delhi Police. All of them were found to have links with a former IM militant who went to fight for ISIS,” the officer claimed.
