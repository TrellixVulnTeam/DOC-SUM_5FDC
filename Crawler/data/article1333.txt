Panaji, Jun 27 (PTI) Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar today said some locals and tourists are trying to make drug-peddling as their business here.
"Though drugs are not manufactured in Goa, there are some tourists who come here to try drugs," Parsekar told a gathering of students during a programme against drug abuse organised by the state police here today.
"Some factions among huge number of tourists arriving in Goa are tempted to use drugs. Because of this, some tourists and some locals are trying to make drug-peddling as their business," he said.
"We have no objection to anyone having a business (in Goa), but it should not be of drugs," he stressed.
The Chief Minister appealed to children to act as 'informants' of state police to help in curbing anti-social activities.
He said the concept of 'Little Police' was introduced in the state across hundreds of schools so that the youngsters are well-versed with policing and can help to stop crimes.
"We want that the tourists should go back from here with good memories of (the state) being a scenic destination," he said.
