The Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad unit of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen Friday staged protests at the district collectorate demanding action against the police officers responsible for the arrests of Muslims who were later cleared of any connection with the Malegaon bomb blasts of 2006.
The party also demanded compensation and rehabilitation for the Muslims who were arrested in this case and recently discharged by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).
AIMIM leaders claimed that nine Muslims were falsely implicated in the bomb blasts case by the Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS). “Investigation in this bomb blast case started under the guidance of then ATS chief K P Raghuwanshi (now retired) and Rajwardhan, the then superintendent of Malegaon police. The CBI team also endorsed the investigation of ATS. But after taking over the probe, the NIA concluded that the Muslims were not involved in the Malegaon bomb blasts of 2006. These people were discharged after 10 years. So we demand that the police officials involved in the malicious investigation against innocent Muslims should be arrested. A first information report should be filed against Raghuwanshi and Rajwardhan,” said Anjum Inamdar, AIMIM president for West Maharashtra.
“All nine innocent Muslims and their families suffered a lot. They were behind bars for nearly five years. The government should give them compensation in the form of a job, a house and Rs 1 crore each,” said Inamdar.
