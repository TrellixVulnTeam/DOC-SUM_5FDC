Taking a strong objection to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s remark that Kashmir is not an internal matter of India, the Janata Dal United JD (U) on Friday said Pakistan is playing the Kashmir card in order to cover its failures and pacify the its citizens.
“Pakistan has no issue to raise, it has been playing the Kashmir card in order to cover its failures. They are playing the card to keep Pakistan unified. They have been raking the Kashmir issue so that they can pacify its citizens which is facing an internal turmoil,” JD (U) leader Sharad Yadav told ANI.
Yadav comments come in connection with Sharif ‘s remark stating that Kashmir is the main pillar of Islamabad’s foreign policy.
During his address at the concluding session of three-day conference of Pakistani envoys in Islamabad which was being simultaneously held along the SAARC Home Ministers’ meet to which the Indian Home Minister was party to, Sharif said “Kashmir issue is not the internal matter of India”, agencies quoted him as saying.
“Desire for freedom is running in the blood of Kashmiris” Sharif said, according to agency reports.
The comments come at a time when Jammu and Kashmir is facing it biggest unrest triggered by the killing of slain Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani.
The Pakistan Government, being aggressive on its stance, has been accusing India of using ‘excessive force.’
Meanwhile, India has repeatedly asked Pakistan not to meddle in its internal affairs.
