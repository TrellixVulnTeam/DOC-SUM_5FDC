A club of young bikers launched a campaign to create awareness about traffic rules on Saturday.
The Soaring Eagles Moto Club members launched the campaign from the Japanese Garden. The club members will visit various parks to make their drive to educate people to follow traffic rules a mission.
President Michaelangelo Francis said: “The objective of the club is to make the young generation, especially the children, aware of the traffic rules since they are more prone to accidents. We have observed that being a young blood, they don’t value their lives enough as speed excites and allures them more.”
The event began with a song and dance performance to entertain and attract the regular visitors of the park.

The organisation also highlighted the negative side of the ‘road rage’ and ‘drunk driving’ through skits. In the end, a session to check the awareness of people about the traffic signs and signals was also held in the form of a quiz.
The club will organise such events every month at various parks across the city.
“We want the number of fatal accidents to come down in the city. The only way to do so is by making people aware of traffic rules and regulations. Our aim is to make the city safe for not only the owners of vehicles. but also for other road users.”
