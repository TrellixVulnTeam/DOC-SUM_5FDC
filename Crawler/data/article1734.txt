@hvgoenka If he's the King of Bhutan, we can imagine the state of beggars there!

This down-to-earth act of its monarch is being hailed as one of the reasons behind Bhutan's consistent standing as the happiest country in all surveys and charts. This act is only one of many as, previously, Wangchuk planted 1,08,000 in honour of his son's birth. Wangchuk is also known as the Dragon king and the people's king. He has travelled extensively all over Bhutan on foot and bicycle to interact with his subjects .
