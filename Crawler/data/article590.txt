Search giant Google has reportedly been served a notice by an Allahabad court on Tuesday for listing, in a search result, Prime Minister Narendra Modi among the top 10 criminals in the world.
The Times of India reported that along with issuing a notice to Google CEO Sundar Pichai and India head Rajan Anandan, the court also ordered the registration of a criminal complaint case against Google and its top officials.
The petitioner claimed that he had earlier written to Google to take the image down but his request went unheard.
However, in June 2015, Google apologised for the search result and also added a disclaimer in related searches that reads: “These results don’t reflect Google’s opinion or our beliefs; our algorithms automatically matched the query to web pages with these images.”
In a statement issued then, Google said: “These results trouble us and are not reflective of the opinions of Google. Sometimes, the way images are described on the internet can yield surprising results to specific queries. We apologise for any confusion or misunderstanding this has caused. We’re continually working to improve our algorithms to prevent unexpected results like this.”
The company added that results to the query “top 10 criminals in India” was due to a British daily which had an image of Modi and erroneous metadata.
