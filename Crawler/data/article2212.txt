The Nepal government on Friday recalled its envoy in India allegedly on the charge of “non-cooperation”. This development comes just hours after the country’s first women President Bidhya Bhandari cancelled her trip to India citing political instability in Nepal.
Bhandari was scheduled to visit from May 9 as the state guest at the invitation of President Pranab Mukherjee. She was also scheduled to participate in a ‘Shahi Snan’ in Ujjain’s Simhastha Kumbh on May 14.
Earlier this week, UCPN-Maoist led by Prachanda triggered political instability by declaring the end of the coalition with the ruling CPN-UML. The Maoists and the opposition Nepali Congress have accused Prime Minister K P Oli for failing to implement the new Constitution, address problems related to Madhesis, expedite the post-quake reconstruction work, failing to check soaring prices and promoting black marketing and corruption. However, Oli yesterday survived a threat to his government after a U-turn by Prachanda-led Maoists who decided not to withdraw support to him “for the time being”.
