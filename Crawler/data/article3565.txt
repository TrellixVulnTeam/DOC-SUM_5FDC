Sharif had made his visit to India last year when he attended PM Modi’s swearing-in ceremony at the Rashtrapati Bhawan in New Delhi. Both leaders have conducted several meetings on the sidelines of summits and conferences in foreign countries.

The relations between India and Pakistan have witnessed some positive developments after a chill lasting several months. The two countries recently decided to launch a comprehensive dialogue after PM Modi and Sharif met on the sidelines of the Paris climate change conference.
Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj had earlier met Sharif in Islamabad at the Heart of Asia conference.
PM Modi had landed earlier today in Kabul where he held talks with President Ashraf Ghani and inaugurated the new Parliament building. He had also made a visit to Moscow where he held comprehensive discussions with President Vladimir Putin and inked several deals.
