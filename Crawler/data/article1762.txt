BSF starts anti-tunneling exercise at J&K border ||||
 The Border Security Force (BSF) has launched an anti-tunneling exercise along the 200-kilometre International Border in Jammu and Kashmir, to detect the possibility of any cross-border tunnel originating from Pakistan. This move comes after a cross-border tunnel was detected near the border in the state's RS Pura Sector in March this year. ||||

The BSF has launched a massive anti-tunneling exercise along the 200-km International Border in Jammu and Kashmir to detect any cross-border tunnels originating from Pakistan.
As part of the operation, BSF troops have started the process of clearing wild growth and tilling the land ahead of the barbed wire fence and up to zero line with Pakistan, said sources.
In areas falling behind the barbed wire fence towards the Indian side, they have started digging trenches to rule out the possibility of any cross border tunnel.
“The troops have been asked to dig 4-foot-wide and 10-foot-deep anti-tunneling trenches in their respective sectors behind the fence running along the IB,’’ a senior BSF official revealed.
“After finding no underground tunnel, while they are refilling the trenches at places, those dug up between two border posts at vulnerable locations are being kept open so that they get filled with rain water during the monsoons,’’ he added, pointing out that through these trenches, the tunnels, if any, will get filled with rain water.
Apart from this, the BSF has also raised the demand for a sensor network that peers through dirt and rock to detect underground tunnels. Israel has offered such equipment, but a decision on the matter is yet to be made, the officer added.
Significantly, anti-tunneling measures on such a massive scale have followed the detection of an underground cross-border tunnel near the IB in the state’s R S Pura Sector in March this year.
