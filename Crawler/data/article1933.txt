Tala Marandi (54), MLA from Borio Assembly constituency in Sahibganj district, was on Tuesday appointed as the Jharkhand BJP president.
Marandi replaced Ravindra Rai, BJP MP from Koderma, who was at the helm for a little over three years. His appointment came a day after the Godda and Panki assembly bypolls.
Marandi’s appointment was confirmed in New Delhi by party general secretary Arun Singh late this evening. Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das congratulated Marandi, saying the party would reach new heights under his leadership.
Starting his political career with the Congress, Marandi joined the BJP in 2003. He won an assembly seat for the first time in 2005 from Borio, defeating Lobin Hembrom of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha.
Marandi could not be contacted. One of his aides said the news came as a “complete surprise”. “His name never figured in any of the discussions or news reports earlier,” he said.
Prem Mittal, state BJP spokesperson, said: “This is an appointment by the central leadership. I cannot comment.”
“There were a couple of names doing the rounds. This is surprising,” said a BJP source.
