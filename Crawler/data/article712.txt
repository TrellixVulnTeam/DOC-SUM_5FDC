New Delhi, Jul 16 (PTI) Union Minister Kiren Rijiju today sought to distance BJP from developments in Arunachal Pradesh where the Congress made a dramatic turnaround by changing its leadership in a bid to save its government.
"The BJP and the central government have nothing to do with whatever is happening in Arunachal Pradesh. The political instability has been happening in last seven months due to the division within the Congress.
"We have nothing to do with the internal matter of Congress," Rijiju, Union Minister of State for Home, told reporters here.
In a dramatic turnaround in Arunachal Pradesh, the Congress party replaced Chief Minister Nabam Tuki by choosing a new leader Pema Khandu, who staked claim to power on the basis of support of 45 party MLAs along with two Independents.
In fast-changing developments, Khaliko Pul, rebel-turned chief minister, who was unseated by the Supreme Court, returned to the party fold with 30 dissident MLAs.
"Change of Chief Minister in Arunachal Pradesh is an internal matter of Congress, BJP has nothing to do with it. It was not a BJP government. BJP only supported the government. Whatever has happened it was due to the tussle over leadership among Congress leaders," Rijiju, MP from Arunachal Pradesh, said.
