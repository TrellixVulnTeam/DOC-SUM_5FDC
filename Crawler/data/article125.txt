What was the key reason behind the selection of Hillary Clinton as the Presidential candidate of the United States? According to A Ramu, AIADMK’s Coonoor MLA, it was his party supremo J Jayalalithaa who inspired Hillary to contest in the Presidential elections.
“In America’s Presidential election, for the first time a woman candidate is contesting and the complete reason for that is Amma (Jayalalithaa),” Ramu said on Tuesday during his speech in the Tamil Nadu Assembly. Party’s first time MLA who joined AIADMK in 2014, Ramu explained his theory behind Hillary’s candidature.
“She (Hillary) visited India and met Amma (Jayalalithaa),” he said, adding that her Presidential candidature was the impact of that meeting (in July 2011).
“Today, the world is celebrating this meeting for its historical importance. Through this meeting, Hillary Clinton understood Amma’s personality and was awestruck by her proficiency in English and her encouragement. Finally, accepting the assuring words of Respected Amma, an overwhelmed US Secretary of State went back to become the presidential candidate. I would like to record that the reason for this is Respected Amma,” Ramu said.
