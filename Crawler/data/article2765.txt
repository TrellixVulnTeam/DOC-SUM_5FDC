Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday said the BJP government was ready to discuss ‘all issues’ during  the upcoming Budget session of Parliament, saying he was hopeful that the Opposition would cooperate.
“The Prime Minister told Opposition MPs that he was not just the PM of the BJP but of the entire nation and that he was ready to discuss all concerns that the Opposition MPs have,” Naidu said, summarising what happened at the meeting called by the PM.
The Opposition has been united in its demand that the Prime Minister react to the ongoing protest at JNU which unfolded after JNUSU President Kanhaiya Kumar was arrested and charged with sedition after he allegedly oversaw ‘anti-India’ protests inside the campus.
