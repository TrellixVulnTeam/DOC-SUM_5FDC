Uday Chopra has rubbished rumours of having ended all connections with Nargis Fakhri. It was being speculated that Nargis had a nervous breakdown after Uday terminated their relationship over a text message, prompting the actress to pack her bags and leave for USA suddenly.
While the latter’s publicist was quick to issue statements announcing that Nargis was taking a break owing to an injury she’d suffered, the grapevine around Uday having broken up started buzzing with every passing day, prompting the Dhoom actor to respond.


In a statement issued by his publicist, Uday addressed Nargis as a close friend and pooh-poohed the recent gossip reportage. Here’s what the statement says:
“I normally don’t respond to gossip, but the press has been reporting a lot of fiction disguised as fact. I would just like to clarify that Nargis and I have been and still are very close friends. The press has done a wonderful job of creating stories out of thin air and I applaud their creativity. However these are all untrue.”
Interestingly, Uday has addressed Nargis as his close friend, a line that the actress has also been maintaining, thus far. In an interview with the IndianExpress.com, Nargis had told us that Uday would remain an important part of her life forever.
