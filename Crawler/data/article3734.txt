Google’s doodle today honours BKS Iyengar, one of the foremost Yoga teachers in India, on his 97th birth anniversary. Through a fun, animated doodle which features an old man identical to Iyengar flitting between different Yoga ‘asanas’ (postures) between the letters of G-O-O-G-L-E, the search engine giant said, “BKS Iyengar, it’s been said, could hold a headstand for nearly half an hour well into his eighties.”
“His style–Iyengar Yoga–is characterized by tremendous control and discipline, which he exercised in ways not limited to confoundingly long headstands,” said Google.
Iyengar, who passed away in August last year, has been honoured with the Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan and the Padma Vibhushan, India’s civilian awards. Iyengar, who is said to have been a teacher to several people including Sachin Tendulkar and Queen Elizabeth of Belgium, is popular for bringing Yoga to the West where he gathered hundreds of ardent followers.
Last year, Iyengar was also named one among 100 most influential people by Time Magazine.
The doodle based on Iyengar on the Google homepage has been designed by Kevin Laughlin and has reached the web platforms of several countries including Russia, US, UK, Indonesia, Canada and Spain.
