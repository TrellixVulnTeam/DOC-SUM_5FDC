Nearly three months after Mohammed Ikhlaq was lynched by a mob in Dadri, police on Wednesday filed a chargesheet against 15 people, including a minor, but there was no mention of beef in it.
52-year-old Ikhlaq was killed over rumours that he had stored beef in his house but police said a forensic report on the type of meat was yet to be received.
Ikhlaq’s daughter, Shaishta, has been made the prime witness in the case.
“Charge sheet has been filed against 15 persons. Additional charge sheet will be filed against few more persons whose names figured in the statement of Ikhlaq’s daughter, Shaishta, recorded before the court. Two persons were arrested today while two others are absconding,” Deputy Superintendent of Police Anurag Singh said.
“Forensic report is yet to be received on whether the meat sample taken from the fridge of the deceased’s house was that of goat or cow. In the chargesheet it is stated that the accused persons had attacked the house of Ikhlaq after the announcement from the temple about cow slaughtering. The accused had found pieces of meat stored in fridge and they had claimed it to be that of beef,” Singh said.
One of the accused is reported to be a minor.
Police said his age certificate is being verified and he will be produced before the juvenile court accordingly.
