The government on Tuesday admitted in Lok Sabha that it has not been able to provide the three per cent reservation to differently-abled people in government services as per law.
“The provision is for three per cent reservation, but it is far less,” Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thaawar Chand Gehlot said during Question Hour.
But at the same time, between May 2015 and April 2016, a special drive was launched to fill up the vacancies which had resulted in filling up of 10,000 posts, he said.
Following the special drive, the figures have risen to over one per cent as against the stipulated three per cent.
In his written response, he said as per the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995, reservation of one per cent each will be made for people with blindness or low vision, hearing impairment and locomotor disability or cerebral palsy in posts identified for each disability.
The national action plan for skill development of persons with disabilities was announced in March 2015 with a view to impart skill training for such people to enhance their scope of employability in public and private sector, he said.
