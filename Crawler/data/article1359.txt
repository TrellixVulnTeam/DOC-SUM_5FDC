The India Couture Week 2016 (ICW), hosted by Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) — India’s apex fashion body — is set to begin on July 20.
The four-day fashion gala vouches to showcase dazzling intricate craftsmanship, interesting trends, and the best of Indian crafts by leading couturiers from across India.
FDCI president Sunil Sethi hopes it’s a success.
“We have always offered the best of India through our eponymous events and the ICW is the most coveted extravaganza in the stable as it showcases couture ensembles, which are emblematic of our rich tradition and historical past,” Sethi said in a statement.
“As we get set to indulge in this unadulterated visual treat, we hope to recreate splendour through the art of luxury,” he added.
