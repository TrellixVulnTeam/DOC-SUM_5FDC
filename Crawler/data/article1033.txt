Consumer products maker SC Johnson says its OFF! brand has been named the official insect repellent supplier for next monthâ€™s Olympic Games, to be held in Rio de Janeiro amid ongoing fears about the mosquito-borne Zika virus.
The Racine, Wisconsin-based company says the repellant will be provided to athletes, volunteers, staff and media at the games.
Seven golfers, including world No. 1 Jason Day of Australia and No. 4 Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland, have cited the virus in declining to take part in the games. Brazil has been the hardest hit of the approximately 60 countries that have reported an outbreak of Zika.
Zika is known to cause severe birth defects, and international health officials have advised pregnant women to skip the games. The virus can also be spread through sex.
