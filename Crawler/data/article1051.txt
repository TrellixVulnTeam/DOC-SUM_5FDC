Pixar has announced that they are not planning any more sequels of “The Incredibles” after the second installment of the movie.
Pixar will be concentrating on original movies once its upcoming slate of “Cars 3”, “Toy Story 4” and “The Incredibles
2” all hit cinemas by the end of the year 2019, reported Entertainment Weekly.
The company’s president Jim Morris talked about the difficulties of getting a sequel started.
“Most studios jump on doing a sequel as soon as they have a successful film, but our business model is a filmmaker
model, and we don’t make a sequel unless the director of the original film has an idea that they like and are willing to go forward on,” he said.
“A sequel in some regards is even harder (than the original) because you’ve got this defined world which, on the one hand, is a leg-up, and on the other hand has expectations that you can’t disappoint on.”
Morris added: “Everything after Toy Story and The Incredibles is an original right now.”
