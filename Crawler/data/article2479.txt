Two persons, including a cousin of former foreign minister Dipu Moni, were brutally murdered in a flat in Dhaka by unidentified killers who entered the building impersonating as courier officials, the latest in a series of brutal attacks on bloggers and intellectuals in Bangladesh.
Julhash Mannan, a cousin of Moni, and his friend Tanay were murdered at the flat in capital’s Kalabagan, the Dhaka Tribune reported quoting deputy commissioner of Ramna division police Abdul Baten. Mannan was also an editor of an LGBT magazine.
Baten said armed assailants in guise of courier company officials entered the flat on the second floor of a six-storey building in Kalabagan around 7 PM and killed Mannan, 35, a former protocol officer of the US embassy and his friend.
There have been systematic assaults in Bangladesh in recent months specially targeting minorities, secular bloggers, intellectuals and foreigners.
Last year, four prominent secular bloggers were killed with machetes, one inside his own home.
In the latest attack, liberal professor AFM Rezaul Karim Siddiquee, 58, was brutally hacked to death on Saturday by machete-wielding ISIS militants who slit his throat using sharp weapons and left him to die near his home in Rajshahi city.
