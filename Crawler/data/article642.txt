'Govt to decide if betting should be legalised' ||||
 The Supreme Court on Monday announced the Parliament will decide whether cricket betting should be legalised in the country. The Lodha Committee recommendations, most of which have been accepted by the Court, called for legalisation of betting in the country, with the exception of players and officials. Applicability of RTI Act to BCCI will also be decided by the Parliament. ||||

Accepting most of the recommendations by Justice Lodha panel, the Supreme Court on Monday ruled that no minister and civil servant can become a member in the BCCI and that they stand disqualified now.
A bench led by Chief Justice T S Thakur also said that one state-one vote rule shall henceforth apply to all state associations. Gujarat and Maharashtra have been allowed to have more than one association but they will have voting right on a rotational basis.
