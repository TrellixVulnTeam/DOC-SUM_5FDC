Actress Nargis Fakhri says she is not comfortable doing adult comedy films in Bollywood.
Though the 36-year-old American model-actress will be next seen in the third instalment in the “Housefull” series, she is not keen being a part of the genre anymore in India.
“I wouldn’t do it (adult or sex comedy films). Also the sense of humour is very different here (India). If you go to America or Germany or London people have different sense of humour. So I might do it (adult or sex comedy film) in America but not here (India),” Nargis told PTI.
Considering English adult comedy films have a market, Hindi filmmakers have also attempted making adult comedies like “Grand Masti”, “Kya Super Kool Hai Hum”, “Mastizaade” and others.


The “Rockstar” actress says she has not seen any Hindi adult comedy film yet.
In Sajid-Farhad directed “Housefull 3”, she will be seen with actors Akshay Kumar, Abhishek Bachchan, Riteish Deshmukh, Jacqueline Fernandez, and Lisa Haydon.
“I think everyone in the film is so good with their work that things became easy for all of us. It was fun workingon this film,” Nargis said.
Besides, Nargis’s next release is biopic “Azhar” alongside Emraan Hashmi and Prachi Desai, while she stars opposite Riteish Deshmukh in “Banjo”.
