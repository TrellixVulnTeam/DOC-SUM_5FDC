Twitter users have slammed a couple who took a selfie with the burning Dubai hotel in the background and posted it on social media.
The fire that engulfed a 63-storey luxury hotel The Address Downtown on New Year’s Eve three hours before midnight was clicked and posted by many social media users with different hashtags, including #Dubaifire.
However, the photo of the couple posing with a selfie with the burning building as a backdrop sparked a storm on the micro-blogging site.
Social media users expressed reactions like “the most inappropriate selfie ever” and “people are stupid” while reacting to the couple’s selfie.

However, there were a few who sided with the couple and thought it was probably an innocent mistake.

According to eyewitnesses, the fire started on the lower floor of the Address Downtown hotel from the outside and spread to the upper storeys.
Officials said one person had a heart attack as a result of the smoke and the rush to get out of the building. Another person was described as being moderately injured and 16 people were said to have suffered minor injuries.
A large fireworks display later went ahead at the worldÂ’s tallest tower in Dubai, the Burj Khalifa, in front of tens of thousands of people while plumes of smoke continued to billow from the nearby hotel fire.
