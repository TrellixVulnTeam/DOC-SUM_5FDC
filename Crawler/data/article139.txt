In a first of its kind attack in the heart of Srinagar, the house of Jammu and Kashmir’s Education Minister Naem Akthar was attacked Monday night. The two-storey bungalow named ‘The Illusion’ was attacked with a petrol bomb.
Akhtar and his family were not present inside the house at the time of attack. Soon after taking charge as minister, he had shifted residence to high-security Gupkar following security concerns. A close relative of Akthar, however, has been occupying the house.
Although the residences of PDP legislators have been attacked in South Kashmir, this is the first show of anger in Srinagar city. Earlier, Akthar’s cavalcade was pelted with stones in Bandipore, his hometown, while he was traveling.
On July 17, PDP assembly member from Pulwama Mohammad Khalil Bandh suffered serious injuries when his vehicle was attacked in Pulwama town. Bandh was shifted to the Army Base hospital and was later taken to Delhi for advanced treatment. In an another attack soon after the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani, protestors had set fire to a building in Kokernag belonging to MLA Abdul Rahim Rather.
On Sunday, National Conference leader Ifthikar Misger, who unsuccessfully contested assembly elections against Mehbooba Mufti in Anantnag, disassociated himself from mainstream politics and decided to resign from the party. He made this announcement at a public rally in South Kashmir’s Anantnag town flanked by some separatist leaders of Anantnag.
