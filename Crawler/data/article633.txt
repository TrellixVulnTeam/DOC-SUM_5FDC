“Whatever the court decides, we will abide by it. I am hundred percent sure I will come clean,” he added.
Responding to a question on why the opposition was demanding his removal, he said, “The opposition is not asking for my resignation today, they have been asking for it from the day I have become a Minister.”
Following the order, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah will take a call with senior leaders on whether George’s resignation should be obtained or not.
They will also discuss whether or not to appeal to the Karnataka High Court in connection with the FIR over George’s alleged involvement in the suicide.
Meanwhile, the opposition has demanded George resignation.
Holding a media conference, Leader of the Opposition Jagadish Shettar said that an impartial investigation could not be conducted as long as George was still a minister. He also said that the two police officers named in the complaint should be suspended to ensure a fair investigation.
Ganapathy was found hanging from a ceiling fan in a lodge in Madikeri, Kodagu district on July 9.
