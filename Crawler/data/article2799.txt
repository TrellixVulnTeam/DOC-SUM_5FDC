S.S. Rajamouli’s magnum opus “Baahubali”, one of India’s biggest blockbusters, will release in over 6,000 screens via E Star Films in China in May.
“This will be the biggest ever release for an Indian film in China, superseding Aamir Khan’s ‘PK’, which released in 5,000 screens. The makers had planned to release the film this month, however, it had to be postponed due to unavailability of suitable dates,” a source from the production team told IANS.
The film has already been sold to over 30 international territories, including Latin America and Japan.
Presently, the shooting of the second part of the film is under way. It is expected to hit the screens later this year or early next year.
