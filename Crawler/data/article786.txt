Parineeti Chopra starring opposite Punjabi hearthrob Diljit Dosanjh -- now that is a Bollywood jodi we can totally dig. The buzz suggests that this pairing will headline a remake of 80s comedy caper, Chameli ki Shaadi.
Parineeti will sink her teeth into the role which was originally played by Amrita Singh while Diljit will play Anil Kapoor's role. While nothing has been confirmed, entertainment website Spotboye reported that Phantom has already bought the rights of the remake and Rohit Jugraj will be directing the film.
The film was a hit all those years back and still remains one of the all-time best comic films made in India. It is said that Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan initially wanted to buy the rights of the remake movie, but Deepak Mukut, who is co-producing the remake had already struck a deal with Phantom's money-handler Mantena, who had earlier produced Ghajini.
The first installment of the movie, which was directed by Basu Chatterjee, also featured late actor Amjad Khan, Pankaj Kapoor and Om Prakash in pivotal roles.
