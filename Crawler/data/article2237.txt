The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Thursday sent reminders to seven countries for the Letter Rogatory relating to the AgustaWestland case, a day after receiving a communication from the CBI. MEA spokesperson Vikas Swarup said the ministry has asked its missions to follow up with the seven countries — Italy, Tunisia, Mauritius, Singapore, British Virgin Islands, UK, UAE and Switzerland — and send “execution reports” to that effect. The CBI has blamed these countries for not responding to its queries relating to the trail of funds in the alleged kickbacks paid in the Rs 3,600-crore VVIP helicopter deal. LR is a formal request from a court to a foreign court for judicial assistance.
