“The local villagers who looked after him all these years were present…The villagers of Puruna Tigiria served him meals everyday,” said Jayant Mardaraj of the erstwhile princely state
of Nilgiri.
Among the 26 princely states of Orissa, Tigiria was the smallest with an area of 119 sq km. After the merger, Mahapatra got Rs 11,200 a year till former PM Indira Gandhi abolished the system in 1975. Having sold off his palace, he left his hometown to live with his brother, but returned to Tigiria in 1987. When The Indian Express met him two years back at Puruna Tigiria he spoke about his lavish life and having no regrets.
