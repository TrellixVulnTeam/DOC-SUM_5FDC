Helen Mirren is the latest female Oscar winner to join the Fast and the Furious franchise, following the casting of Charlize Theron as the villain in the upcoming eighth instalment.
The actor revealed the news in an interview with Elle magazine, while promoting the home release of Eye in the Sky, her 2015 thriller about drone warfare. She said she accepted the role in the sequel for “the fun of it”. Character, as well as plot details, are still under wraps.

Asked if she’s a fan of cars, Mirren said: “I’ve always rather loved driving.
“I said, ‘I’ll be in it, but only if I’m allowed to drive if I do drive in it,’” Mirren told Elle. “But we’ll see. We’ll see how it transpires.”
This marks her first major role in an action franchise since her involvement in Red and Red 2, in which she starred opposite genre veteran Bruce Willis.
Mirren and Theron will be joined by Fast and the Furious stalwarts Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris and the last movie’s official villain: Jason Statham. Straight Outta Compton helmer F Gary Gray is on board as director.
The film is set to open on 14 April 2017, and is the first of a new trilogy taking the series forward following the death of leading man Paul Walker.
