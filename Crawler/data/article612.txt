The Bombay High Court Monday issued notices to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Maharashtra Cricket Association, seeking their response on a PIL alleging violation of noise pollution norms during the Indian Premier League matches.
Advocate Kapil Soni filed the petition in 2014 alleging that noise pollution norms and regulations were violated during the IPL matches held in 2013 at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium and Pune’s Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium and hence legal action should be initiated against BCCI and MCA and heavy penalty imposed.
A division bench of Justice A S Oka and Justice A A Sayed issued notices to BCCI and MCA and posted the PIL for further hearing on September 16.
“Loud speakers were being used and loud music was being played during the matches, even after the prescribed deadline, and thus, violating provisions of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Act. Legal action should be initiated against BCCI and MCA and a cost of Rs 100 crore should be levied on BCCI,” the petition claimed.
