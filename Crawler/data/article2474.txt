Salman is not new to controversies: Katrina ||||
 Actress Katrina Kaif on Monday said that Salman Khan being involved in a controversy is not a new thing. Katrina's statement was prompted by a question on Salman's appointment as India's Goodwill ambassador for the 2016 Rio Olympics. Earlier, Indian sportsmen including Yogeshwar Dutt and Milkha Singh said that a sportsperson, not an actor, should have been made the ambassador. ||||

Katrina Kaif was in her elements at the wrap-up party of Baar Baar Dekho. The actress was fashionably late and was the last VIP guest to walk in. While Katrina did pose for the paparazzi with glee, the pretty actress looked a wee bit skeptical about addressing the waiting journalists.
It took some coaxing from the media contingent to get the lady to give some media bytes. Dragging her co-star Sidharth Malhotra and director Nitya Mehra, Katrina Kaif addressed the press jointly. And for a change she seemed to be in a mood to have some fun even when one of the questions posed were about former boyfriend and her close friend Salman Khan.
When asked about the current controversy courted by Salman over his appointment as the goodwill ambassador of the Indian contingent at the Rio Olympics, a smiling Katrina shot back, “Salman ko leke controversy hai woh naya cheez hai kya?”


Offcourse, what Katrina meant was there was absolutely nothing new about Salman courting controversy. She, however, refused to give her opinion on what she thought about Salman’s appointment as the goodwill Indian ambassador for Rio Olympics.
