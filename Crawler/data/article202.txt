Taking note of a report filed by the Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) that there were 233 manual scavengers employed by various civic agencies in the city, the Delhi High Court Wednesday pulled them up for the “disgraceful” practice.
The bench of Justice Badar Durrez Ahmed and Justice Ashutosh Kumar also noted that the report contradicted the stand taken by the agencies, which had claimed there were “no manual scavengers” in the capital.
The DSLSA had conducted series of surveys along with 10 law students to cover various aspects of the issue of manual scavengers.
“Manual scavenging is just like a business in Delhi and daily wagers are hired from outside Delhi,” the DSLSA said in its report.
The report stated some of the workers engaged as manual scavengers were permanent employees of MCD/DJB, while many others were outsourced with/through private contractors. "Out of 233 identified manual scavengers, there are 104 government employees and 129 outsourced/private workers."
