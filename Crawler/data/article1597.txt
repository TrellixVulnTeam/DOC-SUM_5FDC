Ajay Devgn, who is making a comeback as a director with Shivaay, has unveiled the first look of his film's lead actress Sayyeshaa, the grandniece of veteran actress Saira Banu, on Twitter.
Ajay Devgn retweeted the first look of Sayyeshaa which was shared on Shivaay film's official twitter handle that read, "Here's presenting the ravishing @sayyeshaa Welcome her as she joins the journey of Shivaay."
The poster shows Sayyeshaa face with eyes filled with fear and distress. It also shows two distant icy mountain glaciers where one can see Ajay standing on one cliff and Sayyeshaa on the other who is seen walking with her arms wide open.
