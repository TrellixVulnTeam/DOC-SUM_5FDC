A complaint has been registered against Aam Aadmi Party MP Bhagwant Mann on Friday at Parliament Street Police station in New Delhi after he courted controversy on Thursday by posting a video on social media of Parliament’s security pickets and internal security positions.
Mann, however, defended his act on Thursday saying he was just showing people how the Parliament functions. “Is it illegal, inappropriate to post a video which shows procedure of how questions are taken up in Parliament during question hour,” Bhagwant Mann had said.
He also asked if his video pose a security threat to Parliament. “Kya meri video se sansad khatre mein aa gyi. (Did my video pose a security threat to Parliament),” asked the AAP MP. “I will post a video again tomorrow. Let me be served a notice.”
The BJP called Mann’s act “highly irresponsible” and said he should have shown some sense. “He (Bhagwant Mann) should have had some sense. There already has been an attack on Parliament,” said BJP’s RK Singh.
BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi said, “It needs to be verified if it was act of foolishness or was done under the influence of some agencies.”
Minister of State for Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju also hit out at Bhagwant Mann saying, “Unfortunate that a responsible member of Parliament conducted himself in a manner which is objectionable to all members.”
