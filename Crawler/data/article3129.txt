The Delhi government will add 3,000 buses to its existing fleet, which will include 1,000 premium buses, Transport Minister Gopal Rai said Saturday.
Aimed at affluent passengers, the premium bus service — that is expected to begin by October — will have a host of facilities including online booking from home, no standing passengers, WiFi, marshals, water and magazines, said Rai. While the fare will be higher than other Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses, it will be determined at a market rate.
Following the effective implementation of the odd-even scheme from January 1-15, the government is taking various measures to augment public transport.
According to the plan, 1,000 buses to be run under the cluster system will ply on roads from April-May while 1,000 air-conditioned low-floor buses will hit the streets from August.
Rai said a cabinet note has been prepared on procuring an additional 1,000 cluster buses, which is likely to be cleared next week. These buses may hit the roads by July or August, he added.
While discussions over the next phase of the odd-even scheme are underway, Rai said there are good reasons for both including and excluding two-wheelers. However, he said that in order to make the rule applicable to two-wheelers, it is important to strengthen the government’s bus fleet as the larger part of commuter burden will fall on them.
