India will be sending its biggest ever contingent in the Olympic Games with more than 100 athletes having already qualified in 13 sporting disciplines. The previous highest was 83 that the country sent in the 2012 Olympics in London.
More athletes are likely to qualify in the coming days, and the Sports Ministry and the Indian Olympic Association are expecting more than 110 to represent the country in the Games.
Several of the Rio-qualified athletes are currently training abroad and it is not clear how many will be able to meet the PM tomorrow.
The IOA, on other hand, said its senior vice-president has not been invited by the Sports Ministry for Monday’s meeting.
“Tomorrow’s meeting with the PM is being organised by the sports ministry and they should have ensured that the IOA has enough representation. Only the president, secretary general, chef-de-mission and deputy chef-de-mission have been invited by the sports ministry. They should have invited the senior vice-president and joint secretary also,” an IOA official said.
