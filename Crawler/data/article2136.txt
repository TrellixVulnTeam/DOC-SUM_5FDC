AAP is preparing its ground in Rajasthan for the next Assembly polls in the state, senior party leader Manish Sisodia said on Sunday.
“The Aam Aadmi Party is preparing the ground for the next Rajasthan Assembly elections and I am here for the same. AAP is going to field candidates for it,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a programme in Kota.
The Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi earlier during an interactive session at a private university in Kota said education now needs to be made forward looking which produces student with scientific, critical, entrepreneurial and humanitarian thinking.
Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio in the Arvind Kejriwal dispensation, said, the Delhi government within next three months is going to set up new schools where students would be trained to inculcate practical, professional and critically scientific attitude and aptitude.
Zero is the invention from India and is the total base of current cyber world but due to lack of entrepreneur and scientific approach, we are still deprived from the ownership of the same asset, Sisodia said.
We observe birth and death anniversaries of our great personalities without realising their great legacy, he said.
