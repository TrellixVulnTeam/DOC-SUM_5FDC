SENIOR Supreme Court lawyer H S Phoolka on Saturday accused Punjab Congress president Captain Amarinder Singh of shielding party colleague Jagdish Tytler in the 1984 riots case.
Phoolka’s statements came a day after a Delhi court refused to accept the closure report submitted by the CBI, instead ordering the agency to further probe the former Congress minister’s role in the anti-Sikh riot.
“Captain gave a clean chit to Jagdish Tytler; he did it to become the Punjab Congress president. He is acting against the interests of the victims and against the interests of Punjab,” Phoolka told the media in Ludhiana.
“While talking to media when the Rajiv Gandhi video was released, Amarinder accused me of having made false allegations for 31 years. I challenge Amarinder to prove a single accusation,” Phoolka said.
He added that Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal was taking undue credit for the Tytler judgment.
“The clean chit to Tytler, for the third time, in December 2014 was when Harsimrat Badal was a Union Minister. It has taken a year to get the clean chit rejected. Sukhbir’s claim that they have now given the addresses of two witnesses to the court is rather strange. Sukhbir should explain as to why he did not give the addresses to the CBI earlier. Already 31 years have passed during which time, many witnesses have died. Even in the Tytler case, main witness Surinder Singh has died. Sukhbir should explain as to why he withheld the addresses,” Phoolka said.
