Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday suspended SP’s Badaun MLA, Abid Raza, from the party and its legislature group, for his alleged involvement in anti-party activities. Raza, the chairman of Wakf Development Corporation, used to enjoy the rank of a minister of state in the Akhilesh government.
This comes after Raza had alleged that SP’s Badaun MP, Dharmendra Yadav, was involved in cow slaughtering and illegal mining in the district. He had also claimed that he would “expose” the leader in the state Assembly. On Saturday, Raza’s wife Fatima had alleged that her family was receiving life threats from Dharmendra Yadav. Fatima is the chairman of Badaun Nagar Palika Parishad.
SP spokesperson Rajendra Chowdhrury said action has been taken against Raza after the Badaun unit passed a resolution against him Saturday. Despite repeated attempts, Raza was not available for comment.
