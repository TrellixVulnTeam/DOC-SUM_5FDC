Delhi Metro sets new time limits for passengers ||||
 The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is set to introduce new time limits for passengers in metro stations from January 11 in a move to curb congestion on platforms and the station complex. Passengers paying a fare of 18 or less will not be permitted to stay inside the Metro network for over 65 minutes. Fines will be levied from February. ||||

Grappling with overcrowding on its platforms and station premises, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has come up with a new initiative to ensure commuters exit the network at the earliest and not loiter inside stations.
Come next Monday, commuters paying a fare of up to Rs 18 will not be allowed to stay inside the Metro network for more than 65 minutes. Even as the DMRC has increased its maximum permissible time for commuters paying more than Rs 23 from 170 minutes to 180 minutes — citing an increase in the length of the network — the time band for commuters paying up to Rs 23 has been brought down to weed out idling.
“At present, every commuter is allowed to stay inside the premises for 170 minutes if he/she enters from one station and exits from another station, irrespective of the distance travelled. Every month, more than 1 lakh commuters are penalised for exceeding this time limit. In December last year, 1.08 lakh passengers were booked,” said a DMRC spokesperson.
Following the implementation of the new rule, the time duration will subsequently increase for longer journeys. Initially, those violating the time limit will be let off with a warning. Penalty of Rs 10 per extra hour and a maximum of Rs 50 will be imposed from February 1.
