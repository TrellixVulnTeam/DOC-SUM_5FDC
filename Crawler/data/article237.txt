Mumbai, Jul 31 (PTI) Director Mahesh Manjrekar has dished out details of his next project with Sanjay Dutt, sharing that the actor will be seen as a father in his early 40s.
The film, which is a remake of 2008 superhit Marathi movie "De Dhakka", was annouced on Dutt's 57th birthday on Saturday.
"He will play a 43 or 44-year-old father. He will play a Punjabi man but not a sardar. We will have look test done with him. The film has elements of humor and he is good at comedy, he does it best," Manjrekar told PTI.
Dutt and the 63-year-old filmmaker have earlier colaborated on films like "Vaastav", "Kurukshetra" and "Rakjt".
The makers are currently looking out actress to play Dutt's wife in the film.
"I have name of some brilliant actresses (in mind). We are in talks with some. For the role of daughter and son, we will mostly have new faces," Manjrekar said.
Being made under the banner of Sandeep Singh and Omung Kumar's, Legend Studios, the film as per its Marathi version, promises to be a laughter riot blending with the emotional journey of a family.
"The basic premise will be same. It's a family film. It is about realising that it is family what matters always. There will be elements of humor in the film. The film will be set in Himachal Pradesh. Travel will be the backdrop of the film," Manjrekar said.
While, the director feels the title "De Dhakka" is apt for the Hindi remake, he said he is looking at other titles as well.
