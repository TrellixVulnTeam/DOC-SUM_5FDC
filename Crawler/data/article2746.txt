Salman Khan had earlier revealed that he would come up with a reality show on farming titled ‘The Farm’ with a similar concept like that of Bigg Boss. The Dabangg Khan, who made the announcement earlier this year, has finally tweeted a video wherein we see his rumoured girlfriend and Romanian Television presenter play the host.
Though we fail to understand her language, we see “The Farm” written in Roman in the background. Salman, who spends a lot of time at his farmhouse where he breeds horses, said that he has plans to start the new reality show on farming and is in talks for the same with Colors.

Salman Khan had earlier told Indian Express, “The farm has the same concept as that of Bigg Boss. Celebrities will be spending close to four months on the farm. Here they will have to do everything by themselves right from milking the cow and goat to farming and sowing. A farmer will be present who will teach all the techniques of farming to the contestants.” (Also read: Aamir Khan reveals he has lot of expectations from Salman Khan’s Sultan)
Iulia also took to Instagram to share the video. She wrote in Roman, “Va asteptam in Cipru! Astazi incepem un nou sezon #fermavedetelor. Alta tara, alta distractie! Diseara la 20.30, la #protv #thefarm #tvshow #reality #season2 #newadventure #today #start”, which when translated to English, read, “We expect in Cyprus! Today we start a new season Another country , another fun! Tonight at 20.30 at #protv #thefarm #tvshow #reality # Season2 #newadventure #today #start.”
As Big Boss 9 ended with a bang, we wait desperately to catch Salman Khan on screen with his rumoured lady love Iulia for the very first time.
