The iconic Eden Gardens is all set to get a ‘bell’ like the one that hangs at the hallowed Lord’s ground in London, Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Sourav Ganguly said on Saturday.
The one at Lord’s is located outside the Bowlers’ Bar of the pavilion and is rung to signify the imminent start of play.
It has become a great honour to be invited to ring it on the morning of a Test match and Ganguly had the privilege of doing it once in 2014.
“Yes, we are getting such a bell which will be installed at the Eden Gardens. Every morning it will be rung by a cricketer from either side or ex-players. The bell is being imported and should be in place by September,” the former India skipper told reporters.
A ‘Fan Zone’ will also be created where kids can play and spend time with their families starting from the India-New Zealand Test match in September.
To bring more corporates in to the Tests, the CAB has also decided to hand them tickets for the games.
School, University students are also set to get free-tickets, 10 per cent of the total amount.
