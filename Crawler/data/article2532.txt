Violence has been unprecedented in WB: CPI(M) ||||
 CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury claimed on Saturday that "violence has been unprecedented in West Bengal" and so far "seven of our workers have died" during the elections. "We will meet the challenge. Intimidation will not work as far as the CPI-M is concerned," Yechury asserted. He further claimed that such violence cannot happen unless "patronised" by the ruling dispensation. ||||

Claiming that West Bengal is witnessing “unprecedented” violence, the CPM Saturday claimed that seven of its workers have been “killed” during the ongoing election process but added that the party will not succumb to such “politics of terror” and will instead “meet the challenge”.
“The violence has been unprecedented. So far, seven of our workers have died — four in the third phase and three earlier. Prior to this year’s assembly elections, there had been no murders during the polls. Such intimidation will not work with the CPM,” said party general secretary Sitaram Yechury here.


He said that just like the central forces, the anti-social elements too have been travelling from one place to another ahead of different phases of elections.
The party anticipates an escalation in violence during elections in the fourth and fifth phases on April 25 and 30, respectively, he said, adding that they have written to the Election Commission, requesting it to ensure safety of people who want to vote in a free and fair manner.
