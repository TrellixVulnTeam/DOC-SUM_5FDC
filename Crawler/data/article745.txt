We saw her run away from a confused Ali Fazal. We also her take flight as a bemused Jimmy Sheirgill looked on. She even seem to have left the very eligible Abhay Deol befuddled.

Indiaâ€™s Runaway Bride â€” apologies Julia Roberts â€” has her sneakers on as we now see her escaping on a bike. Diana Penty, who dazzled us with her performance in Cocktail and was never seen again â€” is back to work. She is the Happy of Happy Bhaag Jayegi.
Her character intro describes her as Harpreet Kaur or Happy. Born in a simple family in Amritsar, Happy is meant for strange and sometimes even extraordinary things. She finds her own solutions to all lifeâ€™s difficult problems.

Like running away from the venue, wedding attire, groom and all. For more on why Happy likes running away so much, especiaqlly when a man in sherwani and sehra is involved, watch out for the Mudassar Aziz-directed â€˜run-comâ€™ on August 19.
