Kabali is one of the most awaited releases of the year in India. However, it seems the Rajinikanth film is getting unprecedented traction in the US too.
If reports are to be believed, tickets of the movie, scheduled to be released on July 22, were sold out within just two hours of pre-booking opening in the US.
The movie is the 159th in Rajinikanth's four-decade-long career and is getting a global release. Rajinikanth is already a household name in some international markets like Japan where he has a huge fan following.
The producers of the movie are also trying their best to prevent pirated copies of the move flooding the web.
In the US, distribution company CineGalaxy, which had released Theri and 24 earlier this year, will release Kabali.
“It will be the biggest release for a Rajinikanth-starrer in the US. The Tamil as well as Telugu version of the film will release in 400 screens,” Madhu Garlapati of CineGalaxy told IANS earlier.
According to Madhu, there’s unprecedented pre-release buzz for the film.
Directed by Pa. Ranjith, the film also stars Radhika Apte, Kishore, Kalaiarasan, Dinesh, Dhansikaa and Taiwanese actor Winston Chao.
Rajinikanth will be seen as a don who fights for Tamils in Malaysia in Kabali, which will also dubbed and released in Hindi and Malay
