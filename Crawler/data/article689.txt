Chandigarh, Jul 16 (PTI) In a bid to reach out to young voters in Punjab, Congress will allot to youths 35 of its 117 tickets in the Assembly election slated next year, state party chief Amarinder Singh today said.
The decision, taken on the suggestion of Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, will see a huge jump in the number of Congress tickets being allotted to youths, as against six to seven tickets given in 2012 Assembly polls.
Youth representation will be based on their hard work and contribution towards the party and not any kinship or relationship, he said.
Addressing a function here to announce the merger of Punjab-based Youth Organisation of India and induction of about 100 AAP workers into Congress fold, Amarinder asked the youths to join the political process.
Noting that the Assembly polls next year is going to be his last and his only aim was to see smile back on the faces of all Punjabis, the Congress leader said, "The future belongs to all of you and Congress wants your maximum participation in leadership and representation in the Vidhan Sabha."
"I am aware of your expectations and aspirations and I want you not only to realise your own dreams but also be a part of the entire decision making process at political and economic level," he said.
The former Punjab Chief Minister also said if Congress forms government in Punjab next year, it will ensure "one job to each family" in both private and government sectors, besides developing and providing entrepreneurship skills and opportunities to youth.
