BJP Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel kept his word as he violated the odd-even road rationing scheme Monday. The MP, however, had to pay a fine of Rs 3,500 — He had to pay Rs 2,000 for violating the scheme and Rs 1,500 for not having his insurance papers and driver’s licence.
But before he left his Ashoka Road home in the morning, he had a surprise visitor. Transport Minister Gopal Rai came to Goel’s house and urged him not to violate the rule, and presented him with a rose.
Stating that the BJP is not against any scheme that will help improve air quality in the capital, Goel said, “I told the transport minister that I am not against any effort to bring down pollution, but I am against AAP’s political posturing. The party has spent crores of rupees of taxpayers money on advertisements. I asked them to make the expenditure on odd-even public.”
Goel alleged that the advertisements are not just restricted to Delhi but are aired in Goa and other states as well. He added, “If it is so successful, then it should be made permanent, not every month for 15 days. That way, crores of rupees will be saved.”
Responding to Goel’s allegations, Rai said, “It is not a matter of how much money you can pay for a challan… the scheme is vital for the life of people of Delhi. We will publish as many advertisements as necessary to make odd-even popular as it is for people’s life.”
