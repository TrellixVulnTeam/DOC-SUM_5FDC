NEET in J&K violates special status: Abdullah ||||
 Former Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah on Wednesday said the Supreme Court order forcing all states to conduct the common medical entrance test NEET violates J&K's special status. He claimed that the Centre cannot conduct NEET in the state as "medical education is expressly in the state list for J&K and not in the concurrent list". ||||

Former Jammu & Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah Wednesday said the Supreme Court verdict disallowing the state to hold a separate entrance test for MBBS and BDS courses was an “infringement on our special status and autonomy”.
The apex court recently upheld the applicability of National Eligibility and Entrance Test (NEET) to J&K. The court also clarified that with higher education being placed in the concurrent list, the Centre’s notification for NEET would override the orders of states which may want to conduct their own CETs.
“Initially, medical education was in the state list. Some time ago, it was brought into the concurrent list across the country other than J&K. So when the Centre decided to hold NEET as a single common entrance test for the entire country, it wasn’t applicable to us…Medical education is expressly in the state list for J&K and not in the concurrent list. This means that the Centre doesn’t have the powers to hold this entrance test in J&K,’’ said Omar.
He added that during his tenure as CM, a plea was filed challenging the Centre’s order. “We had raised this issue. There is not an iota of doubt that it is an infringement into the special status and autonomy of J&K state,’’ he said.
While the National Conference has been opposing the decision to extend NEET to J&K, the PDP has been busy trying to contain the political fallout by claiming that state laws and all reservation rules applicable in CET (Common Entrance Test of J&K) would be applied for admissions to J&K colleges.
