New Delhi, Jun 22 (PTI) The Delhi government's transport department has issued an order banning the retrofitting of CNG kits in "in-use" cars in the view of some CNG kit manufactures supplying "unapproved and uncertified" CNG fuel kits.
The department has directed its motor licensing officers (MLOs) not to register vehicles that have been retrofitted with CNG kits till further orders.
"There were allegations that some CNG kit manufacturers are supplying unapproved/uncertified and sub-standard CNG kits for retrofitting in the 'in-use' vehicles, thus cheating the vehicle owners by charging them prices of original kits.
