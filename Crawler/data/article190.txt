Never thought I'd be destined to play out a real-life character. That of Abdul Karim. Stephen Frears is one of my all time favourite directors- from dangerous liaisons to the queen he's made it all. So iI can't wait to take on Judi. She's the cherry on this wonderful pudding . The most loved woman in Britain and probably the world. It was a process of endless auditions and readings and conversations and today I am so glad they grilled fully into it to a point of no return. I am ecstatic and I guess it hasn't really sunk in.
