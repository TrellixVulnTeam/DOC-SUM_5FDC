NEARLY THREE months after a UK-based woman filed a complaint against Indian hockey team captain Sardar Singh alleging sexual harassment, the Ludhiana police Tuesday said the complaint stands disposed of from their side as no evidence has been found against Sardar during probe.
The Special Investigation Team constituted by the Ludhiana police commissioner to probe the case has found that the duo did not stay overnight at Bhaini Sahib and thus rape allegations by the woman, a UK resident and also a former international hockey player, were “false”.
Ludhiana police commissioner J S Aulakh said, “None of the allegations by the woman has been found to be true. We enquired with Bhaini Sahib dera if the two stayed overnight there. The woman had alleged that Sardar sexually abused her during their meetings at Bhaini Sahib. But our probe shows they never stayed there overnight. No incident of sexual harassment has been found at Bhaini Sahib.
From our side, investigation is complete, the complaint is disposed of and no proof was found against Sardar Singh,” said Aulakh.
