Sachin Tendulkar’s first involvement came through a written question to the Ministry of Railways. The Master Blaster received a written answer from Manoj Sinha, Minister of State for Railways. There was another query, to Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, on the changes in provisions for issuing of driving licences. Reply on the same is expected Monday.
“Will the Minister of Railways be pleased to state the rationale behind creating a new zone for Kolkata Metro and whether it can be replicated in other cities such as Mumbai, Chennai and Delhi that also have similar suburban rail services; the criteria that a suburban railway system must fulfil to enable it to be notified as a separate zone; and whether the above three cities fulfil that criteria and are eligible for being notified as separate zones?,” asked Tendulkar.
