The first prosecution for violating Delhi government’s odd-even scheme took place at ITO junction about 33 minutes after the restrictions became operational at 8 AM on Friday.
The offender, who was slapped with the stipulated Rs 2,000 fine, told police that he was heading towards his office and there was no convenient transportation facility from his residence near Pari Chowk, the intersection between NOIDA and Greater NOIDA, said a senior traffic official.
“The offender, who was driving a car with its registration number ending with 2 (even), was prosecuted at the ITO intersection around 8.33 AM,” the official said.
“The offender claimed that he knew about the restrictions but had no other option,” said the official.
As the much-debated Odd-Even scheme restricting movement of private cars in the national capital was rolled out today, Delhi Police Commissioner B S Bassi once again appealed to people to cooperate with his force throughout the 15 days.
Under the scheme, private cars having odd registration numbers will be allowed to ply on odd dates and those with even numbers on even dates.
