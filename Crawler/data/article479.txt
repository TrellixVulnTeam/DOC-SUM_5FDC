Visakhapatnam, Jul 23 (PTI) Andhra Pradesh Government will open `MeeSeva' centres in all Panchayats with a view to provide public services to citizens in a transparent manner, Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu today said.
"MeeSeva" (at your service) is a good governance initiative that incorporates the vision of National eGov Plan "Public Services Closer to Home" . The objective of MeeSeva is to provide smart, citizen centric, ethical, efficient and effective governance facilitated by technology.
The TDP-led Government has been utilising technology in a big way to provide services to people as part of its commitment towards transparent administration, he said.
Naidu was addressing a gathering after inaugurating a MeeSeva centre at a new commercial complex constructed by the Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (VUDA) in Seethammadhara area here.
The IT, Electronics and Communication Department is the prime force behind MeeSeva, which provides Government services like issuing certificates related to birth, income, caste and agriculture land details, among others.
Technology is being used to avoid delay in providing services to people and also eliminate middlemen, Naidu said, adding every Panchayat in the State will have MeeSeva centre.
At present, there were 485 MeeSeva centres in the district and another 100 will be added soon.
Stating that Government will continue with welfare schemes launched for benefit of the people, he said the administration has been conducting a `pulse survey' to gather details of all the residents.
