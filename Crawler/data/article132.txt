A day after being cleared by National Anti-Doping Agency, Narsingh Yadav met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday in New Delhi. Narsingh had thanked PM Modi after he was cleared of doping charges by NADA. After meeting the Prime Minister, Narsingh said that PM Modi told him to perform better and their would never be injustice done to him.
“Unhone aashirwaad diya, kaha ki aur achcha kariye,aapke saath kabhi anyaye nhi hoga (He wished me luck and said that you perform and there will never be injustice done to you),” Narsingh said.
Narsingh had failed a dope test on June 25, the report of which came on July 16. But the wrestler had claimed that it was a conspiracy against him and someone had spiked his food and water at the SAI centre in Sonepat, Haryana.
The NADA formed a three-member panel to review the issue and exonerated Narsingh saying that there was no negligence on the part of the wrestler and he did not take the banned substance intentionally.
The ruling raised Narsingh’s chances of going to Rio, for which he has to clear a dope test and then wait if United World Wrestling, World Anti-Doping Agency and International Olympic Association clear him.
But Narsingh is optimistic that he will go to Rio and take part in the 74-kg men’s freestyle wrestling which will be held on August 19. The Wrestling Federation of India is also backing him for representing India in Rio.
“I believe I will definitely go for Rio Olympics and will win medal for my country,” he said.
