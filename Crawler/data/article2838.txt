The jaundice outbreak has hit Shimla’s economy with tourists avoiding visit to the hill station despite recent snowfall. There is a significant 25 to 30 percent drop in the tourists flow after the outbreak that has affected nearly 2,000 people and claimed over half-a-dozen lives.
The state government has already issued an alert in and directed the Chief Medical Officers (CMOs) and Deputy Commissioners to create awareness among the locals about jaundice and get water storage tanks cleaned-up beside checking sewage treatment plants.
“I must admit that business is hit by outbreak of jaundice. It has scared away tourists from Shimla. We had some cancellations last week. Some tourists booked at Shimla hotels later headed for Manali and others even dropped their plans,” a Shimla hotelier told The Indian Express.
President of Shimla Hoteliers Association Harnam Kukreje said, “State government must do something to save Shimla from jaundice. There is also need to improve water supply position as summers are going to have a tough time due to delayed snowfall.”
