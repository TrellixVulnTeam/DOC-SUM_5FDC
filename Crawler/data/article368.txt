Protests erupted yesterday after authorities lifted the curfew from Srinagar, South Kashmir districts and other areas.
Meanwhile, the mobile internet services were restored in the Jammu region on Tuesday after remaining suspended for 17 days in view of protests in Kashmir valley following the death of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Muzaffar Wani.
Fearing a backlash in Jammu region after the start of protests in the valley, the authorities had decided to snap mobile internet services across 10 districts of the region.
Barring BSNL post-paid mobile connections and landlines with broadband connections, the authorities suspended mobile telephony and mobile internet services across the valley following protests.
With communication snapped, Kashmiris outside the state have been expressing concerns over their familiesâ€™ welfare with some students complaining that they were running out of money.
