The Governor of Jammu & Kashmir and Chairman of Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board NN Vohra today inaugurated the Shrine Board's Bulk Short Message Service (SMS) which has been started for the first time to add a new facility for facilitating the pilgrims of the annual Amarnath Yatra which commences on July 2.
The bulk SMS service is aimed to enable the pilgrims to become aware about the arduous nature of Yatra and the precautions they are required to take before and during their pilgrimage. Frequent bulk SMSs will be sent on the mobile phones of the intending pilgrims who have registered themselves in advance and have also provided their mobile numbers.
The SMSs will cover the do's and don'ts and the health advisory to be followed during this pilgrimage. All other important pilgrim related information including weather forecasts or any other messages in case of any emergency will also be disseminated through these SMSs to the pilgrims who have registered in advance.
The Governor has once again appealed to the intending pilgrims and all the stakeholders of the Yatra to maintain cleanliness and sanitation in the entire Yatra area, from the base camps onwards, to preserve the natural environment. He has particularly requested the stakeholders not to use polythene or any other non-biodegradable materials.
