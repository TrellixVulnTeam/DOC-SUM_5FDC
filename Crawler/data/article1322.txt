A Delhi court on Monday dismissed the bail plea of AAP MLA Dinesh Mohaniya in an alleged molestation case and sent him to 14-day judicial custody.
“There is no change in the circumstances in the last 2 days to interfere with the duty magistrate’s June 25 order. This second bail application of accused is dismissed,” Metropolitan Magistrate Bhavna Kalia said.
The duty magistrate on Saturday had denied him bail and sent him to Tihar jail for two days till today.
Mohaniya was arrested on Saturday on charges of molestation and sexual harassment amidst high drama when he was addressing a press conference, triggering an angry reaction from Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal who accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of declaring an “emergency” in Delhi.

Mohaniya, who is also vice chairman of Delhi Jal Board, was virtually dragged from his seat by a police official when he was talking to reporters at his office in Khanpur in South Delhi, at around 12.10 PM.
Reacting sharply to the arrest of the party MLA, Kejriwal had said in a tweet, “Modi declares emergency in Delhi. Arresting, raiding, terrorising, filing false cases against all those whom Delhi elected (sic).”
Mohaniya is the eight AAP MLA to be arrested by Delhi Police since the party came to power for the second time in Delhi February 2015.
