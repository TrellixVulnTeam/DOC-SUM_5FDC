A maternity hospital in Syria was bombed in a shameful and illegal act that sent babies crashing to the floor in their incubators, said Save the Children charity organisation. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has confirmed this report and said that perpetrators are not known, reports the CNN.
Two people were killed when a bomb struck the entrance of the hospital, in the northwestern city of Idlib, the organization said. A woman who was six months pregnant had her leg severed and two other women suffered shrapnel wounds to their stomachs. Babies and a number of patients and staff also suffered injured.
“Bombing a maternity hospital which is helping women living under the shadow of war to give birth safely is a shameful act, whether it was done intentionally or because due care was not taken to avoid civilian areas,” Save the Children’s Syria Director Sonia Khush said.
Khush added that unfortunately, this is only the latest in a series of strikes on health facilities in Syria.
Speaking from the charity’s office in London, spokeswoman Emma Pomfret said: “The bomb hit the entrance of the hospital, which sees 1,300 women monthly and carries out over 300 deliveries a month.”
