Chennai today turned a virtual island and several coastal areas of Tamil Nadu were marooned by flood waters after unprecedented rains in 100 years pounded the city, its suburbs and neighbouring districts destroying crucial road and rail links, shutting the airport and rendering thousands homeless.
The death toll in the rains that have lashed the city and other parts of state has gone up to 197, officials said.
