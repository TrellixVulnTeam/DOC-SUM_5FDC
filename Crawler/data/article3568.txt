At least 24 people were killed when a passenger bus plunged into a ravine after a head-on collision with a truck in northern Afghanistan, officials said today, in the latest deadly road accident. Women and children were among those killed in the accident today on a major highway in Samangan province.
“The crash happened when the bus carrying more than 50 passengers was travelling from Kabul to Mazar-i-Sharif,” said Sarajuddin Fitrat, the governor of Hazrat Sultan district where the accident occurred. “Twenty four people were killed and 17 others were injured.”
The defence ministry in Kabul gave a much higher death toll of 43. The injured were rushed to hospital while police and a rescue team retrieved the bodies. Afghanistan has some of the world’s most dangerous roads and deadly accidents are common.
At least 18 people were killed in May when a minivan overturned in the western province of Badghis. And in April 2013 a bus hit a wrecked fuel tanker in the southern province of Kandahar, killing 45 people. The World Bank in November signed off a $250 million grant to upgrade roads crossing Afghanistan’s Hindu Kush mountains, crucial trade links that are often closed in winter by snow.
