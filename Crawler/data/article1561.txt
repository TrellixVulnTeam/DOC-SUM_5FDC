Srinagar, Jun 18 (PTI) With legislators alleging huge bunglings, Jammu and Kashmir today told the Assembly that it will carry out a probe into implementation of a law which provides for regularisation of land under illegal occupation.
The government announcement followed Speaker Kavinder Gupta's directive in this regard after the issue was raised during the Question Hour by the opposition National Conference legislator Mubarak Gul.
Gul, who was joined by members from ruling BJP and PDP, alleged huge bunglings in the implementation of the Roshni Act which was brought in 2001 and was meant for selling the government land at market rates to the illegal occupants.
Gul and BJP MLA Rajiv Jasrotia alleged huge bunglings in allotment of land under the Act, saying politicians and bureaucrats had benefitted from it.
"When the Roshni Scheme was launched, the then government had claimed that it will generate a revenue of Rs 25,000 crore and the money will be spent on construction of new power projects in the state. But only Rs 78 crore revenue has been generated under it," Jasrotia said.
"It seems a big fraud. The land has been transferred to influential politicians and bureaucrats. The basic purpose of generating revenue of Rs 25,000 crore has been defeated. Government should reveal names of politicians and bureaucrats who have benefitted under the Scheme," he said, adding, "the government is hiding their names."
Jasroita was supported by other BJP legislators and PDP MLA from Sonawar, Mohammad Ashraf Mir, who questioned the government as to why the names have not been revealed.
The legislators demanded a probe into the whole issue after which the Speaker directed the government to investigate into it.
"I too had asked some questions," Gupta said, adding "I direct the government to hold an immediate inquiry into the Roshni Act."
Minister for Revenue Basharat Bukhari then assured the House that an inquiry would be conducted to reveal the facts about the whole scheme.
Earlier, replying to a question, Bukhari said 229691 Kanals and 2 Malras (11619 hectares) of state land have been transferred to 50,157 beneficiaries as per the Act.
The minister said 19,293 Kanals (976 hectares) of land have been transferred among 10,328 beneficiaries in Kashmir and 21,0398 Kanals (10643 hectares) among 39,829 beneficiaries in Jammu region.
