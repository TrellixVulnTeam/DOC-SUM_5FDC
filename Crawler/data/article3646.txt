Congress Saturday said the BJP government’s decision to allot a bungalow to Subramanian Swamy, the petitioner in National Herald case, was an “award for dragging the Congress leadership to court”. “He has been given Z-category security and allotted a government bungalow. He is not an MP nor from a border state. He is not facing any threat from any terrorist organisation…The bungalow was given as an award for dragging the Congress leadership to court,” said Ghulam Nabi Azad, Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha.
Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, “Swamy is a stooge of PM Narendra Modi, he is a mask that Modi and BJP is using to unleash malicious political vendetta.”He also defended the decision to convert Associated Journals Ltd (AJL) into a Section 8 non-profit company, asserting that the move wasn’t related to the case. “The plan was to convert AJL into a non-profit company so that no one can use it assets, no one can make a single rupee of financial benefit,” he said. “The conversion was part of the 2011 revival plan for National Herald. It was decided much before Swamy’s complaint,” he added.
