Senior BJP leaders lashed out at the Trinamool in West Bengal Monday at the first of the four big rallies scheduled this month by the party with an eye on the forthcoming assembly elections.
Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, who arrived here with BJP national general secretary in-charge of West Bengal Kailash Vijayvargiya and national secretary Siddharth Nath Singh, said, “Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is doing vote bank politics…she is appeasing one section of people and sheltering criminals to use them during the election to rig polls for her…PM Narendra Modi has sent me here with his assurance that the Centre will always stand by your side.”
Vijayvargiya said that anti-social elements found Bengal under the TMC government a safe haven. “It is a very sensitive area. So much so that the CM patronises all those people who are involved in all kinds of illegal activities… During elections here, goons from the other side of the Bangladesh border come to the state and are pampered here because they work for the CM and help her rig the polls,” he said.
