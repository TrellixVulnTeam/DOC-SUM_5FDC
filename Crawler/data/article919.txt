New Delhi, July 9 (ANI): We can't think of a 'Khalnayak' sequel without Sanjay Dutt, who nailed his role of 'Balaram Rakesh Prasad "Ballu" in the film and indeed filmmaker Subhash Ghai too feels the same.
Subhash, 71 and Sanjay, 56, are back together for the film's sequel titled 'Khalnayak Returns'.
The Mumbai Mirror quoted Subhash, as saying, "We've made an agreement to produce KhalNayak Returns which will roll by the year end or early next year. I'd met Sanjay when he was out on parole and discussed the idea with him."
"He (Sanjay Dutt) made a soundtrack with some voice over in the background which I loved. Impressed with his passion for the film, we decided to take the idea forward," he added.
When asked Ghai about the sequel, he revealed the story- line, saying the movie would kick off with Ballu character coming out of the jail after 20 years to find himself in a completely different world. But, the circumstances will take him back to the world of crime.
"It'll be a multi-starrer with many new characters. You never know, Ballu might find another khalnayak, among them," he said.
The 'Ram Lakhan' director also revealed that the title track of the movie, 'Nayak Nahi Khalnayak Hoon Main' would be retained in the sequel and he is yet to take a call on the track 'Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai'.
The old 'Khalnayak' featured Jackie Shroff and Madhuri Dixit in lead roles and movie was a hit at the box office. (ANI)
