Shimla, Jul 4 (PTI) The Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has sanctioned 56 national highways to Himachal Pradesh with a total length of 3,993 km, Union Health Minister J P Nadda today said and requested the state government to expedite preparation of detailed project reports (DPRs).
Addressing a press conference here, Nadda said Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari had visited all four Lok Sabha constituencies of Himachal Pradesh and discussed the requirement of roads with all concerned including chief minister, ministers, MLAs, MPs and other local representatives and approved 56 road projects.
The NDA government sanctioned four National Highways (NH) last year and with 56 new roads, the total number of highways would go up to 60 and Rs 13,000 crore would be spent on it, he said.
Nadda said the NDA government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been very liberal towards Himachal Pradesh.
There has been phenomenal rise in devolution of funds to the state and share in central taxes had been increased from 32 to 42 per cent while the grants-in-aid have increased.
The funding of centrally sponsored schemes in the ratio of 90:10 between the Centre and the state against the ratio of 60:40 had been restored due to intervention of Modi.
