From January 1 to January 15, every car entering Delhi will have to follow the odd-even registration number rule as the government sets out to implement an idea to reduce congestion on roads and pollution from vehicle emission. The odd-even rule will also apply to cars with NCR and other states’ registration numbers, official sources told The Indian Express.
A notification to this effect is being readied. It also lists over 20 categories of vehicles which will be exempted from the rule. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is likely to spell out Thursday his government’s decisions on exemption, inclusion of vehicle categories.
The rule will be applicable from 8 am to 8 pm on all days except Sunday.
Proposing a Rs 2,000 fine for every violation of the odd-even rule, the Delhi government, in line with provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, has sought the Lt Governor’s authorisation for officials to issue challans.
