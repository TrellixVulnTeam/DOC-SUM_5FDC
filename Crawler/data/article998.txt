Indian athletes travelling to Rio de Janeiro for next month’s Olympics will get Indian food in the Games village.
The Sports Ministry today said that some athletes had requested for Indian food in the Games village.
“We have got confirmation from Rio Olympics organisers that our athletes will be served Indian food throughout the Games. It will be part of the official Games’ menu,” Sports Secretary Rajiv Yadav said.
“We had got a request from some of the athletes for their preference for Indian food. Getting the right food is essential if the athletes have to give their best in Rio,” he said.
The Indian Olympic Association too had requested the Olympics Organising Committee to include Indian cuisine in the menu at the Games Village.
Yadav also confirmed that the athletes will get their daily allowance from the moment they land in Rio.
“We have doubled the daily allowance too, from USD 50 to USD 100. Some of the athletes had mentioned to us that the earlier amount was not enough.”
India is sending its largest ever contingent to an Olympics. Hundred plus athletes will represent the country in Rio Games beginning August 3.
Asked on the ministry’s medal projection, Yadav said: “It is difficult to predict but we are hopefully of getting into the double digits”.
India won an unprecedented six medals at the 2012 London Olympics.
