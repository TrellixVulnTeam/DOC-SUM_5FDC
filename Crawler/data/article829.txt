Former CBI chief Ranjit Sinha,  who is accused of meeting coal scam accused during his tenure, received a setback today.
The Supreme Court appointed probe committee has informed the apex court that "prima facie it seems that ex-CBI Director Ranjit Sinha did try to influence probe in coal scam".
During argument over the case, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi told the court that further action based only on committee reports could not be allowed as no examples of Ranjit Sinha arbitrarily upturning decisions have been found.
However, the petitioner said the SC-appointed committee has provided more than adequate material for prosecution. Hence it is important to to probe if Sinha got any kickbacks.
Sinha was quoted as saying by ANI: "I have not seen the judgement yet so can't comment."

The panel found that the coal scam accused had visited the CBI chief. It also found that Sinha tampered with the proceedings of the coal scam probe and his decisions were influnced by meeting with the accused.
Meanwhile, SC has reserved order to decide on what action to be taken against Sinha in view of the panel's finding. 
Allegations of conflict of interest have been raised against Sinha, who is accused of meeting several 2G and coal scam accused during his tenure as the head of the probing panel.
The registry diary, which was maintained by Sinha’s security, was accessed by Bhushan. The diary exposed the meetings of a number of coal scam accused and their intermediaries with Sinha on a number of occasions.
