NEW DELHI Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed a sweeping liberalisation of rules on foreign direct investment on Monday, saying they would make Asia's third-largest economy the most open in the world.
"Key reform decisions were taken at a high level meeting chaired by the PM, which makes India the most open economy in the world for FDI," Modi said in a tweet.
