Shan Johnson (29), singer and daughter of famous Malayalam music composer Johnson who passed away in August 2011, was found dead in her Chennai apartment on February 5. Sources close to her family said she was working in Chennai and stayed at an apartment near Kodambakkam.
Shan was to travel to Kochi Saturday to prepare for her second marriage. Her first marriage was a failure and she had been legally separated.
A senior police officer said Shan’s mother Rani (55) was in Chennai and the two were to travel to Kochi together.
“We are told that she reached home around 9.30pm Thursday. Her mother is at a relative’s house in Mylapore,” an officer said. He added that when Shan did not respond to calls, her mother alerted one of her friends, who reached her apartment. When Shan did not open the door despite repeated attempts, police was alerted. “When we broke open the door, she was lying on the bed. There were no signs of a suicide. She has been suffering from health problems and was under medication. That could also be a reason for the sudden death,” he said. Police has registered a case of unnatural death and sent the body to Royapettah general hospital for postmortem.
Her father Johnson had composed songs for more than 300 Malayalam films and won several state and national awards.
