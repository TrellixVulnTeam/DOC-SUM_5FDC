Microsoft Selfie app comes with 13 photo filters and other features like automatic exposure, noise reduction and intelligent enhancement. It also considers user’s gender, age etc in order to bring out the best selfies. Users can either click pictures with filters from the device’s rear or front camera; or choose an existing photo from storage. The app is compatible with iOS 8.0 and above.
Earlier in the year, we saw how Redmond-based giant used machine learning technology to detect user’s age when it launched ‘How-old.net”. The Microsoft site allowed users upload an image and the site then guessed their age, based on the picture.
