The district collector of Odisha’s backward Koraput district in an official notice has barred people and officials wearing T shirt and jeans from visiting him.
In a notice pasted at his office on Wednesday, district collector V Jayakumar in a 3-point note made it clear that under no circumstances people and officials wearing T-shirt, jeans shirt and jeans are allowed in his office. “They should be properly dressed. Besides, their mobile phones should be put on silent mode or switched off when coming to the office,” the notice said.
Though the 2009-batch officer did not respond to calls, officials in the district said the collector recently had reprimanded a junior engineer who had come wearing jeans and T shirt. “Is this your home,” the district collector alleged to have told the official. On a few other occasions too, he had admonished officials over wearing T-shirt in office.
 
Tribals account for 50 per cent of the total population of Koraput and are known to be dressed in dhoti and kurta. The younger tribals prefer jeans and T-Shirt.
Calling the notice as outrageous, former Koraput MP and tribal leader Jayaram Pangi said the collector should focus on real issues. “Does the collector think he is running a school and he is the headmaster,” asked Bikram Majhi, a tribal student of the district.
