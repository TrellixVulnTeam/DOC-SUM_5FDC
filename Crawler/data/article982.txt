Superstar Shah Rukh Khan went down memory lane on the festive occasion of Eid on Thursday and shared that he used to get only Rs 11 during his childhood days as Eidi.
Talking about his children and their “eidi”, Shah Rukh, who hosted a press conference on the occasion of Eid at his residence Mannat, said: “There is no special gift that we give to one another. We just wear brand new white clothes. But I think boys in the house have a problem wearing white kurta pyjama as all of them are modern. We forcibly make them wear the white kurta pyjama.”

SRK has two sons Aryan and AbRam, and daughter Suhana.
“I used to get Rs 11 in my childhood as Eidi. My family members or grandmother used to give us money mostly tied up in a cloth or in an envelope. I don’t remember much about it because my parents passed away when I was very little. I used to visit my friends’ home or someone would come to our house,” he said.
Shah Rukh also said that superstar Salman Khan-starrer Sultan, which released on Wednesday, is definitely on his must-watch list.
“I haven’t seen Sultan, but I’ve heard it is nice. When I get time, I will watch it,” he added.
Dressed in a white kurta-pyjama himself, SRK also shared his fitness mantra.
“I eat less, exercise for 30 minutes and think fit to be fit.”
On the work front, he is wrapping up his thriller drama “Raees”, slated to hit the screens next year.
