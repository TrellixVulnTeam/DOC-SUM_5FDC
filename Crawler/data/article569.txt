The newly released Mammootty starrer-“Kasaba,” has landed in a controversy with Kerala Women’s Commission today issuing notices to the actor, the movie’s director and producer for some scenes and dialogues allegedly portraying women in a poor light.
Commission chairperson, K Rosakutty Teacher, said since the film had incorporated dialogues and scenes allegedly insulting womanhood, notices have been issued to Mammootty, director Nithin Renji Panicker and producer Alice George.
The Commission also decided to write to Film certification board and film bodies like AMMA (Association of Malayalam
Movies Artistes) and MACTA (Malayalam Cine Technicians Association) to ensure that scenes and dialogues portraying women in a bad light are avoided at the time of certification itself.
“In the name of freedom of expression, women cannot be insulted,” the commission said, adding, when an actor like Mammootty makes such “sub-standard dialogues”, it will lead to a “dangerous acceptance” of such actions and remarks in the society.
“Actors like him should desist from enacting such scenes,” the commission said.
The film has received flak for some alleged crude dialogues delivered by superstar, who threatens a senior female police officer on duty.
