Udaipur, Jul 26 (PTI) Patidar agitation leader Hardik Patel has expressed fear that he might be killed in a fake encounter in Rajasthan, where he is staying.
"The police have confined me and I fear that I could be killed in a fake encounter while being termed a terrorist. Probably, the home minister of Rajasthan is acting (against me) at the behest of BJP president Amit Shah," he told reports last evening.
The 22-year-old leader said the Gujarat High Court has directed him to not enter the state for the next six months but the police has not allowed him to move out of the place where he is staying here in Rajasthan.
Patel also said he would support the communities which have raised reservation demands in Rajasthan.
