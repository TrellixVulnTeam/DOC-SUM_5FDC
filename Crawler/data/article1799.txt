He was also full of praise for Sports Minister Sarabananda Sonowal who visited Sports Authority of India’s (SAI) NIS centre in Patiala during the recent election season. Modi praised Sonowal for his dedication in nurturing sport in the country.
He said, “I want to appreciate Sarbanand Sonowal. In the poll season he went to NIS Patiala for a surprise visit. Everybody was surprised and noted how a Union Minister showed so much concern. There were polls, he was a CM candidate but Sonowal performed his duty as a sports minister. This is a big thing.”
To end his discourse on the Olympics, Modi said, “I will say it again, please do not see everything as a win or loss. It’s about sportsman spirit and creating the right atmosphere.”
