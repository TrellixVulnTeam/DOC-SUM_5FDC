The first set of draft guidelines for cadaver kidney transplant were issued on Friday, a move that is expected to streamline organ donation in the country.
The guidelines for Allocation Criteria for Deceased Donor Kidney Transplant lay down the process for registration of prospective recipients and a committee to approve the registration of patients and need for urgency, if any. The draft was posted on the website of the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO), and all stakeholders have been asked to provide feedback by January 16.
A number of hospitals have been listed in the document, where a patient may be registered for inclusion in the waiting list for cadaver donations. The patient, who has to be below 65 years, will be rated by the committee by what is called an allocation scoring based on criteria like time on dialysis, age, previous history of graft failure, filed hepatitis B or C treatment.
Union Health Minister J P Nadda said, “This initiative reflects our commitment to promote organ donation. These guidelines will go a long way in promoting organ donation in the country.”
