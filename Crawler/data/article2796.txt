From the controversial Delhi Jan Lokpal bill to health facilities to its expenditure on bettering the education system in the state, advertorials highlighted the government’s performance in its first year.
On Saturday, deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia took to Twitter with a Reddit-like AMA addressing questions raised by Delhi residents on his government’s ties with the Centre, traffic issue plaguing the city as well as the recent JNU protests. Read more about that here.
The Congress party, that has no representation in the state Assembly, gave the AAP government a zero in terms of performance and even released an e-booklet highlighting the failure of Kejriwal sarkar.
