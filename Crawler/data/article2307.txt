Reports of the couple getting back together surfaced when the two were spotted together on a lunch date with their children recently.
Last week, Sussanne had also tweeted a picture of them in happier times in a show of support to the 42-year-old actor, who is embroiled in a bitter legal battle with “Queen” actress Kangana Ranaut.
The interior designer took to Twitter to say that an image leaked online showing Hrithik hugging Kangana was photoshopped.
“pictures are photoshopped and untrue stories carry 2 much weight.another pic for d rec. I support @iHrithik in this (sic),” Sussanne had said.
