Kangana Ranaut’s stupendous success in her professional career- courtesy women oriented roles- seems to have made the actress jittery about playing heroine to actors even as internationally renowned as Irrfan Khan.
The Queen actress was initially approached by director Sai Kabir to play the female lead in his movie Divine Lovers opposite Irrfan Khan. But the actress apparently declined the offer stating she is interested only in solo leads.
When Irrfan was asked about losing an opportunity of teaming up with Kangana, the actor sarcastically remarked, “Kangana has gone so out of reach that I will work with her only if I wish to be a heroine. So if a script comes along wherein she plays the hero and I the heroine, I will do it.”


Wonder if Kangana has grown too big for her boots today!
