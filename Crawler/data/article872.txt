Claimed to be first-of-its kind initiative in the country, a modern unisex salon and gym, which will also offer its services to the transgenders, was launched in Coimbatore on Monday.
Luxx Spa and Salon Director J Shivaprakash said his objective was to create awareness among the public about the transgender community.
“At a time when the transgenders are marginalised in the society, we are trying to reach out to them out of humanity,” he told reporters.
The spa also boasts of special luxury rooms for transgenders, Shivaprakash said.
The spa was inaugurated by Ace Formula Driver Narain Karthikeyan and Tamil film actor Sethuraman.
