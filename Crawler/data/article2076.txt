650k cr impact on economy by drought: Assocham ||||
 The drought faced by ten Indian states will roughly cost the economy at least 6,50,000 crore, said a report by trade association Assocham. The report claimed the drought's impact was likely to remain for at least six months. It reached the figure by assuming the government would spend 3,000 per person for one or two months, on 33 crore people. ||||

Drought in 10 states is estimated to impact the economy by at least Rs 6,50,000 crore as about 33 crore people across 256 districts are facing the grave situation, a study has revealed.
Due to two consecutive years of poor monsoon, water shortage in reservoirs as well as lowering of ground water table has created a serious challenge for the drought-affected areas in 10 states like Maharashtra and Karnataka, the study by Assocham said.
“The rough estimate indicates that this drought will cost national economy at least Rs 6,50,000 crore or say $100 billion,” it said.
The impact of drought is likely to remain for at least six months more because one needs resources and time to revive the activities on ground even if monsoon is predicted to be normal this year, it said.
“Let us assume, the government will spend just Rs 3,000 per person to cover water, food, health for these people for one or two month. With the population of 33 crore at risk, the estimated cost to economy will be about Rs 1,00,000 crore per month,” the study said.
The loss of subsidies on power, fertiliser and other inputs multiply the impact, it added.
On economic impact of drought, the study said the financial resources get diverted from development to aid and the possible migration to other places puts pressure on urban infrastructure and supplies.
There is likely an impact on children and women health besides farm debt increase due to loss in livestock and farm economy in the drought-hit districts, it said.
The drought would create inflationary pressures making the food management an imperative challenge for the government and the policy makers, he added.
