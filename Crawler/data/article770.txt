SIT recommended a total ban on cash transactions above Rs 3 lakh and “an Act be framed to declare such transactions as illegal and punishable under law.”
It also felt that, given the fact of unaccounted wealth being held in cash which are further confirmed by huge cash recoveries in numerous enforcement actions by law enforcement agencies from time to time, the cash transaction limit can only succeed if there is a limitation on cash holding.
IT has suggested an upper limit of Rs 15 lakh on cash holding,” the statement said.
In case any person or industry required holding more cash, it may obtain necessary permission from the Commissioner of Income Tax of the area, the panel opined.
