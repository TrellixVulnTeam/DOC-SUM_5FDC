Rajamahendravaram(AP), Jul 21 (PTI) In order to save energy in power utilisation, 42 lakh more LED bulbs would be distributed in the state in addition to the 1.90 lakh bulbs already distributed, an official said.
With the use of 1.90 lakh LED bulbs, nearly 1,500 million units were saved in energy utilisation, which in monetary terms is equivalent to Rs 600-700 crore.
The state has targeted to distribute 2.32 lakh LED bulbs by this month-end and the remaining 40 lakh would also be distributed soon, State Energy Conservation Mission CEO A Chandrasekhar Reddy said here yesterday.
He was speaking at the East Godavari District energy conservation committee meeting held here.
Under this policy, each household was given two LED bulbs at the rate of Rs 10 each on subsidy basis and now efforts are being made to make available LED bulbs to the public for Rs 85 in open market, Reddy said.
The state is also contemplating to replaceï¿½nearly 16 lakh old pump sets in the coming five years which will save 3,000 million units every year, he said.
The Centre has quoted Andhra Pradesh as a model state in energy conservation methods by using LED bulbs, with regard to LED-based street lighting in all urban local bodies, Reddy said.
East Godavari District Collector H Arun Kumar, who presided over the committee meeting, said a pilot project to replace ordinary pump sets with energy efficient ones has been taken up in Rajanagaram mandal.
