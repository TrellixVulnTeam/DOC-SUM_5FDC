Aamir Khan is known to play roles which require him to work on his body to look different each time, especially where there is a requirement for the film. So while he got a perfect eight-pack for Ghajini, he lost all that bulk to play a lean 19-year old Engineering student in 3 Idiots. This process was repeated in Nitesh Tiwari's Dangal. And he has invited words of admiration from his contemporary superstar Shah Rukh Khan. ALSO READ: Aamir Khan introduces his champion daughter in new poster
The Swades actor marvelled at Aamir's dedication to physically transform himself into a character, which he said he wasn't capable of doing as well. "Aamir is very disciplined and works really hard on his body. Two years ago, when I had met him, he had put on a lot of weight and now he has lost all those extra kilos. I can never be as disciplined," said Shah Rukh.
Aamir Khan had initially put on weight to play the role of a 55-year old well-past-his-prime wrestler Mahavir Phogat. And then towards the end of the filming schedule he got back into killer shape to play the younger version of Mahavir. Shah Rukh Khan, on the other hand says he only began paying attention to his body after he got a six-pack for Om Shanti Om.
Dangal follows the story of real life Haryana wrestler Mahavir Phogat and his two daughters and nieces, and their journey to become champion wrestlers in their own right. The film is slated for release in December, 2016.
