Retired Chief Justice of India, Markandey Katju, will now head a panel that will advice the Board of control for cricket in India (BCCI) on implementations of Lodha panel recommendations.
According to the reports the BCCI Working Committee met on Tuesday at the Cricket Center in Mumbai to decide on the implementations of the judgement delivered by the Supreme Court of India. The members suggested that the implementations were complex in nature, as per the official BCCI reports, and the board would need time to implement the Lodha panel recommendations.
The members also agreed that a panel headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court be assisted by three other counsels including Abhinav Mukerjee and the counsel of BCCI.
The Working Committee stated that the recommendations “would involve large-scale changes”. The members said, “Many technical and legal aspects were likely to come up in the future. Considering the complexities of the issue, it was unanimously decided that This panel will be a single point interface for the BCCI to interact with the Justice Lodha Committee as well advise and guide the BCCI.”
The Working committee “unanimously” decided that retired Justice Markandey Katju would be the suitable choice to head the panel.
