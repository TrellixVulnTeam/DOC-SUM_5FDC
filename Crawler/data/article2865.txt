Salman Khan also shared another picture of his clean shaven look from Sultan.

Salman Khan had been sporting a stubble and handle bar moustache all these months now. And in the week of Valentine’s Day, India’s most eligible bachelor, even at 50, will be seen in his much-loved clean shaven look.
In a picture tweeted by Sultan movie’s official Twitter handle on February 8, Salman Khan was seen sporting a clean face reminding one of his look from Prem Ratan Dhan Payo.

Well, we wonder if there is a real life Begum waiting in wings for the Sultan if Bollywood.
Anushka Sharma will be romancing Salman Khan in Sultan and the actress has already started shooting for the movie.
Sultan is going to release on Eid this year and is all set to clash with Big release ‘Raees’ starring Salman’s close friend Shah Rukh Khan.
