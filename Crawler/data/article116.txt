Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s health condition is stable and she is recovering after she suddenly fell ill during her roadshow in Varanasi on Tuesday, party leader Randeep Singh Surjewala told news agency ANI.
Sonia Gandhi was in Varanasi to launch party’s election campaign for Uttar Pradesh ahead of 2017 Assembly elections. However, she suddenly fell sick and her event was cut short in between and she was taken to the airport where she was attended by a team of doctors in the VIP lounge.
Gandhi was scheduled to visit Kashi Vishwanath temple to conclude her visit to Varanasi. “I will come back again and visit Kashi Vishwanath,” she said to her followers while leaving for the airport.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also took to Twitter and expressed concern for her health. He also offered medical assistance and a private plane to carry her from Varansi to New Delhi.
This was Sonia’s first-ever visit in a decade to Varanasi as she decided to launch the party campaign from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constituency.
