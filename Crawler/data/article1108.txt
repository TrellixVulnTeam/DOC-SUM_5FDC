Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has slammed RJD chief Lalu Prasad over his comments in which he advocated that former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi should be made Union Minister replacing Paswan. Lalu Prasad on Sunday on sidelines of Iftar party at JD(U) leader Gulam Gaus's residence proposed Manjhi to be made a Central Minister as Paswan has turned old.
PASWAN ATTACKS LALU  
Paswan attacked Lalu saying that he feared no one except him and therefore he was making such comments. Paswan questioned that why despite being most senior leader in RJD, Abdul Bari Siddiqui was not made deputy CM in Bihar and why Lalu made his son Tejaswi deputy CM.
Paswan said, "Lalu is afraid of Ram Vilas Paswan. If Lalu is fearing anyone that is me. Abdul Bari Siddiqui is most senior in RJD, so why did Lalu make Tejaswi deputy CM, why didn't Lalu make Siddiqui deputy CM ?".
" Lalu fears none except me and my MP son Chirag Paswan," added Paswan.
