Goa’s Feni is all set to go places as the state government gets ready to amend the four-decade old Excise Act to give the traditional brew a ‘Heritage Spirit’ tag.


“The state government will move an amendment to the Goa Excise Duty Act, 1964, which will save Feni from being tagged as country liquor and instead would be classified as Heritage Spirit,” Commissioner of Excise, Goa, Menino D’Souza said. The amendment is likely to be moved during the upcoming monsoon session of the Goa Assembly scheduled for July.
The move is expected to open up markets for Feni across the country.
The Feni distilling industry has been demanding removal of the country liquor tag as the brew has already won the Geographical Indication recognition. Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar recently announced the decision to accord Feni the status of a Heritage Spirit. “We want to place Feni alongside tequila and scotch, which was once the country liquor,” D’Souza added.
Feni marketing has hit a roadblock due to the country liquor label as its sale is not allowed in any other state except Daman.
