BJP and its allies on Thursday secured simple majority by bagging 64 seats in the 126-member Assam Assembly. BJP alone has won 44 seats and is leading in 17 while its allies Asom Gana Parishad won eleven seats and led in three others and Bodo People’s Front retained nine seats and was leading in three others.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi termed BJP’s victory in Assam as “historic” and “phenomenal” and said the party will do everything possible to fulfil the dreams and aspirations of the people of the state and take its development journey to new heights.
Congress, which had 68 seats in the outgoing House, managed to win only 21 seats and was leading in just four
others. The performance of the main opposition party in the outgoing assembly AIUDF turned out to be poor as it won only nine seats and was leading in four others. Compounding its owes, its chief Badruddin Ajmal lost to Congress candidate Wajed Ali Choudhury in South Salmara.
BJP’s Chief Ministerial candidate Sarbananda Sonowal won a convincing victory in Majuli (ST) seat and outgoing Congress chief minister Tarun Gogoi did so in Titabor.
