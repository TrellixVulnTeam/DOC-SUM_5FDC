With Vijay Rupani being appointed as the chief minister designate for Gujarat, the Shiv Sena on Saturday asserted that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was feeling the heat from the Aam Aadmi Party and Patidar community leader Hardik Patel which had resulted in this move.
“AAP has started aggressive campaigning and somewhere the BJP seems cornered or feels the threat from them and Hardik Patel. The BJP seems to be under some stress,” Shiv Sena leader Manisha Kayande told ANI here.
According to reports, AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal will announce the party’s plans to contest the Gujarat assembly election.
Kejriwal has visited Gujarat twice in July and the AAP has become quite active in the state building its base.
Yesterday, in a crucial meeting attended by Amit Shah and Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari at the party headquarters in the state, the decision to make Rupani as the next Chief Minister was announced.
Gujarat’s health minister Nitin Patel was appointed as the Deputy Chief Minister.
The decision came as a major twist as Patel was the frontrunner for the post after Rupani had bowed out from the race, saying he would like to work for the party.
Thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah for reposing faith in him, Rupani asserted that his team is fully committed to harnessing aspirations of the poor, marginalised, farmers and youngsters.
