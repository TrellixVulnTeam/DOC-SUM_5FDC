Don't advise Muslims on number of children: SP ||||
 Samajwadi Party on Saturday said the Constitution gives Muslims the "freedom to decide on how many children they should have" and there is no need to advise Muslims regarding this. This comes after Union Minister Giriraj Singh's recent comments demanding a two-child norm across religions, otherwise "our daughters" might have to be kept "under the veil" like in Pakistan. ||||

Samajwadi Party on Saturday said there was no need to advise Muslims on how many children they should have as the Constitution has given them the right to decide.
Talking to reporters here, SP National General Secretary Mohammad Arshad Khan said “The Constitution had given them freedom to decide on how many children they should have. There is no need for advise Muslims in this regard.”
He was replying to a question on Union Minister Giriraj Singh’s controversial remark that if the country’s population policy is not changed to mandate a two-child norm across religions then “our daughters” will not be “safe” and might have to be kept “under the veil” like in Pakistan.
“I want a law in which Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians can have only two children. If we want the country to develop then it will not happen without population control,” Singh said at an event in Bihar’s Champaran two days ago.
On chanting of ‘Bharat Mata ki jai’, Khan said he has no objection to it as ‘Bharat Mata ki jai’ and ‘Madre vatan Hindustan’ are same.
Khan claimed that under the SP government not a single innocent Muslim had gone to jail on terror charges and his party will bag more than 300 seat in the coming elections.
To another question, he said there was nothing wrong if mosques were used for political activities.
