New Delhi, May 22 (PTI) Home Minister Rajnath Singh today directed security forces to take "strongest possible action" against militants involved in killing six Assam Rifles personnel in Manipur.

The Home Minister also spoke to Assam Rifles Director General, who apprised him of the situation and action taken so far.
