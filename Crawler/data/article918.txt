Fatehgarh Sahib, Jul 9 (PTI) Shiromani Akali Dal workers, led by former Fatehgarh Sahib MLA and party area in-charge Didar Singh Bhatti, burnt the effigy of Aam Aadmi Party convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal here today over the youth manifesto issue.
The protest was staged in the backdrop of AAP using the image of Golden Temple superimposed with its election symbol 'broom' on the cover of its youth manifesto in Punjab.
Akali leaders took out a protest rally at Sirhind market area and later, blocked traffic near the bus stand on Sirhind-Chandigarh road for about an hour.
Bhatti told the gathering that AAP has hurt the religious sentiments of the Sikh community.
