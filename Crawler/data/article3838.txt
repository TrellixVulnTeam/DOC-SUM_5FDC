Fourteen people were killed when the Howrah-Bhopal Weekly Express crashed into their SUV at an unmanned level crossing at Lapanga village in Jharkhand’s Ramgarh district Tuesday night.
The victims comprised two brothers, their sister, their families and the driver. They were all residents of Kori village, which is located nearby. Superintendent of Police M Tamilvanan said they were returning from the tonsure ceremony of a child at the Rajrappa Temple when the incident happened. Seven of those killed were children, while four were women.
“The accident spot is 200 m away from Bhurkunda railway station. The driver was a local man, so he must have taken the crossing, which is usually used by bikes,” said the SP. He said the spot was close to a bend and that may have kept the train from the driver’s view.
The train was travelling at 90-100 km/hr, said police. After hitting the car, it had dragged the vehicle alongside for about a kilometre.
