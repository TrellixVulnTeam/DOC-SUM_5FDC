The Delhi University Tuesday told a local court that documents pertaining to Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani’s BA course in 1996, as mentioned by her in an affidavit filed during 2004 Lok Sabha elections, were yet to be found.
The university’s response came in pursuance to the court’s earlier order summoning documents from its School of Open Learning department on the allegation that while Irani’s affidavit for 2004 polls claimed that she completed her BA in 1996, another affidavit by her for the 2011 Rajya Sabha poll from Gujarat had mentioned her highest qualification as B.Com (Part I) from DU.
“1996 documents related to her (Irani) BA are yet to be found,” Assistant Registrar of the School of Open Learning, O P Tanwar, told Metropolitan Magistrate Harvinder Singh. Tanwar, however, submitted documents related to Irani’s education, including the admission form for B.Com (H) course of 1993-94 and its result and further her enrollment-cum-admission form for first year BA (H) Political Science course of 2013-14.
The Assistant Registrar also informed the court that Irani’s Class 12 documents, submitted with the admission form of B.Com (H) course, were yet to be found. He, however, added that “verification must have been done before the admission”.
The Delhi court has now asked the SDM of north Delhi to bring documents filed by Irani with her affidavit for contesting 2004 polls from Chandni Chowk constituency. The matter has been fixed for further hearing on June 6.
