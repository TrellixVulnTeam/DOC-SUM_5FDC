IN THE Sheena Bora murder case, accused Sanjeev Khanna, the former husband of main accused Indrani Mukerjea, has claimed that as per the evidence put forth by the CBI, he was at two different locations at the same time on the day of the murder.
Khanna, whose first bail application is being heard in the special CBI court through his lawyers Hrishikesh Mundergi and Shreyansh Mithare, claimed disparity in the CBI’s claim of him being present when Sheena was killed.
His lawyers said that Rahul Mukerjea, who was in a relationship with Sheena, had said in his statement that he dropped Sheena at Amarsons in Bandra between 6.30 pm and 6.40 pm. Rahul, in his statement, had also said that he saw Indrani with driver Rai and an unknown person. The CBI claims the latter was Khanna.
“One of the witnesses, the driver who picked up Sanjeev Khanna from the airport on April 24, said he had dropped him to a hotel in Worli where he checked into at 6.05 pm and was at till 6.23 pm. How would it be possible for him to reach Bandra in such a short span during traffic hours?” said Mundergi.
He added that around the same time when the CBI claims that Indrani, Rai and Khanna were at the Mukerjeas’ Worli residence in Marlow building after the murder on April 24, 2012, Khanna had ordered a meal at his hotel room at 9.36 pm and received it after signing a bill. The arguments are expected to continue on Tuesday.
