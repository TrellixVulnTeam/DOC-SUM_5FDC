Veteran CPM leader, five-time MLA and former deputy speaker of the Tripura assembly Sunil Kumar Choudhury committed suicide at his residence in Sabroom, about 140 km from Agartala. The 86-year old Choudhury was cremated with state honours on Monday.
Police in Sabroom said Choudhury had left behind a suicide note in which he mentioned the unbearable pain caused by a disease he was suffering from as the reason behind his decision. Choudhury’s body was found hanging from a coconut tree in the compound of his house on Sunday. He had recently undergone a brain surgery, reports said.
A member of the undivided Communist Party of India since 1953, Choudhury had opted for the CPM when the party split in 1964, and was first elected to the then Tripura Territorial Council in 1962. The next year, as the Council was upgraded into a legislative assembly, Choudhury was elected from Sabroom, and then for four consecutive terms from 1978. He served as deputy speaker of the assembly from 1993 to 1998.
Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar described Choudhury’s death as an irreparable loss to the party.
Choudhury is survived by his wife, four daughters and a son.
