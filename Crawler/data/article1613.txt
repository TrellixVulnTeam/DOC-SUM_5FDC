New Delhi, Jun 17 (PTI) Congress veteran Sheila Dikshit tonight said she was ready to play "any role" either in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh or Punjab and that time was running out for the party to finalise its strategy for the elections in the two crucial states.
She said decision on party's election campaign and whether to project chief ministerial face for the polls should be taken at the earliest.
"Time is running out for Congress. Decisions regarding our strategy in both Punjab and Uttar Pradesh should be taken as soon as possible. Whatever decision is taken should be taken at the earliest," she told PTI.
Dikshit's comments came a day after she met party president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi amid speculation that she may be made the party's chief ministerial face for next year's assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh or may be given a major role in Punjab.
"I am ready for any role that the party high command wants me to play. The polls in both Punjab and Uttar Pradesh will be crucial for us," 78-year-old Dikshit, who served as Delhi Chief Minister for three terms, said.
Asked specifically whether she was ready to be Congress' chief ministerial face in UP, Dikshit did not give a direct reply but said she would follow the leadership's direction.
