Upbeat after registering an emphatic victory in Assam, BJP president Amit Shah said the country has moved a step forward in making a Congress-free Bharat. Addressing a press conference at the BJP headquarters in Delhi, Shah said that the mandate in the recently concluded elections for five state assemblies was overwhelmingly for ‘politics of performance’ which saw the decimation of the Congress.
The BJP-AGP alliance won a two-thirds majority in Assam which ended a 15-year rule of the Congress led by Tarun Gogoi.
Thanking people for supporting the BJP, Shah said the party will work hard to ensure that Assam is counted among the developed states of the country.
Shah said that BJP’s performance in assembly elections was in a way people’s stamp on performance of the Narendra Modi government in the last two years. “Poll results show that a strong foundation of BJP has been laid for ensuring victory in 2019 Lok Sabha polls,” he said.
The BJP president also took a dig at the Congress for stalemate in Parliament. “The verdict is a lesson for Congress for its obstructionist politics in Parliament.”
On its performance in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Shah said that the party has maintained its vote share in these two states.
