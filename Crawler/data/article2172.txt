Veteran actor Gulshan Grover, who came into limelight through his portrayal of Kesariya Vilayati (also known as ‘Bad Man’) in 1989 blockbuster “Ram Lakhan”, says no actor can play the famous character better than him.
Ace filmmaker Rohit Shetty is reportedly planning to remake the Subhash Ghai directorial with actors Shahid Kapoor and Ranveer Singh in the lead.
Gulshan got a lot of acclamation for his negative portrayal in the film. Though he feels no other actor in the industry has the ability to play the character in the remake.
“That was the best character. Today that character Badman is turned into a web-film, ‘Badman’. How fantastic I must be in that film,” Gulshan said during his visit to the IANS headquarters here on Friday.
Asked who can play his part in the remake, Gulshan said: “I don’t think so there is anybody who can play my part. Nobody. That character had a lot of looks, a lot of certain kind of delivery.


“It was not tremendous acting histrionics in that. I don’t think any actor has that ability to portray that character. Only one person can play ‘Badman’. That is me.”
The original film starred veteran actors Jackie Shroff and Anil Kapoor in the lead as Ram and Lakhan.
“Badman”, which will be aired on Viacom18’s digital platform Voot, will feature Gulshan in the lead role.
The web-film will be aired in four parts starting mid-May.
