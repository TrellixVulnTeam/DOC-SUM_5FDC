New Delhi, Jun 23 (PTI) BJP and Congress today hit out at the AAP government for hiring a Public Relation agency to publicise its works, saying it was "wasting" public money for "image makeover".
"Instead of Spending on Public Welfare-AAP Government spends Tax-Payers money for Professional help to build image! (sic)," Ajay Maken, president of Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) tweeted.
BJP MLA and Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Vijender Gupta said: "18 months after the historic win, the Kejriwal government requires a PR agency and is spending crores to improve its image".
"The government hired a private PR agency despite having an army of media advisors, own advertising agency -- Shabdarth and Directorate Information and Publicity. It is wastage of hard earned public money," he said.
Reacting to it, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds information and publicity portfolio, said the government committed no crime by hiring a PR firm.
"Some tv channels are saying the AAP government has spent Rs 200 crore to hire a PR agency. This is incorrect. Hiring a PR agency to publicise government's works is not a crime. Let the Lt Governor order a probe into the matter," Sisodia told reporters here.
