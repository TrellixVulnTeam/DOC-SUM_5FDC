Actor Saif Ali Khan will train under top chefs and learn culinary skills to get his act right in the remake version of “Chef”.
“Chef”, a 2014 American comedy drama, is written, produced and directed by Jon Favreau and is now set to be made in Hindi.
“Airlift” director Raja Krishna Menon will direct the film in Hindi with Saif Ali Khan in the lead.
“The film requires lot of preparations. Saif will undergo extensive training for two months or so to look and act like a chef. He will learn culinary skills, take cooking classes, also get trained under an experienced chef from India and abroad. We will also put him in kitchen after his training,” Raja told PTI.

The director said Saif himself is keen on making things look convincing in the film.
“He (Saif) is excited about the film. He feels that the film requires prep (preparation for the role). We don’t want anyone to question,” Raja said.
The makers are yet to zero-in on the lead actress.
The film revolves around the life of a professional chef, who quits his job at a popular Los Angeles restaurant after refusing to compromise his creative integrity to its controlling owner and later launches a food truck with his friend and son.
“The film is set in India. The basic idea is same but the way the story progresses is different. We will shoot at five-six different locations. The shooting mostly will begin after monsoon,” Raja said.
The remake version of “Chef” will be produced by Abundantia Entertainment, Eros International and Alumbra Entertainment.
