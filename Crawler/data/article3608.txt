The Rajya Sabha on Tuesday passed the long-awaited Juvenile Justice Bill with an overwhelming majority from the members of the House. The juvenile Bill proposes to try the accused who are above 16 years of age as an adult in the court of law. The bill, which was first introduced by Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi in August 2014, has already been passed in Lok Sabha. Maneka has thanked everyone for supporting the passage of the bill.
Left parties staged a walkout after the Speaker declined CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury’s request to send the Bill to a parliament select committee for further examination.
“Today you are demanding the juvenile age to be reduced from 18 to 16 what if tomorrow a 15-year old commits a horrendous crime,” Yechury said.
The December 16 Delhi gangrape victim, Jyoti Singh’s mother, who was present during the House debate, said she was satisfied that the bill has been passed, but is unhappy that her daughter didn’t get justice. Jyoti’s father said that the bill is a tribute to his daughter.
