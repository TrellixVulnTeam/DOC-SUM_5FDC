Panaji, Jul 3 (PTI) In a shocking revelation, Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar today said 90 per cent of total constructions in the coastal state are "illegal" and people staying in them live under constant fear of demolition.
Blaming the "complicated" laws and "tedious" process related to securing requisite permission for construction activity for mushrooming of unauthorised structures, he said his government will bring a legislation in the upcoming session of the Assembly for regularising such structures in certain cases.
"The laws related to construction in the state are complicated (in nature) because of which several Goans have constructed their houses illegally," Parsekar told PTI in an interview on the eve of his 60th birthday.
"Almost 90 per cent of the constructions in Goa are illegal," the Chief Minister said, adding people are staying in these illegal structures under the constant fear of demolition of their houses.
He said, "Those houses which are in the own or tenanted lands or (were) constructed with the consent of legal owner will be regularised."
The government was simplifying the procedure for getting the construction licences so that people can avail them easily.
Responding to a query, the CM said the government has managed to win back the confidence of investors.
"Industries have begun applying for expansion of their existing projects, besides new investors are looking at the state as a good place to put in their money," he said.
Parsekar said the issue of unemployment will be settled "finally in year 2020 during the next tenure of government (post 2017 polls)".
