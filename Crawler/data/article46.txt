For India, Apurvi Chandela and Ayonika Paul failed to advance in the 10 metre air rifle event at the National Shooting Centre. However, Jitu Rai was impressive to qualify for the finals of men’s 10m air pistol event. Gurpreet Singh, India’s other participant in the same category, failed to advance. In the final, however, it was an early exit for Jitu Rai who finished a lowly 8th.
Rio 2016 Olympics Shooting: As it happened for India athletes 
# Jitu Rai eliminated! eighth place finish for the Indian shooter with score of 78.7. The poor start didn’t help in a highly competitive line-up
# To stay alive, Jitu now needs quality shots to avoid elimination. He’s 8th with 68.6
# Brazil’s Felipe Almeida leads the chart with 62.5. Still a long way to go but a good start by the local shooter
# Jitu Rai with a poor 9.7 now. It’s a quality eight-member final. Can’t afford 9s. Plenty of 9s not the ideal start to Jitu’s final
# Jitu Rai, with 28.9, is at the eighth position at the moment. Three shots taken
Korea’s Jin Jongoh and China’s Pang Wei are favourites for gold in 10m air pistol
