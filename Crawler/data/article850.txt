The Urban Development Ministry has reduced land rates for health institutions, maternity centres, night shelters and orphanages to a “No Profit No Loss rate” of Re 1, and also slashed prices of land for DTC depots, and government offices.
Minster for Urban Development Venkaiah Naidu Monday said, “The Urban Development Ministry has approved minimum rates of premium Delhi Development Authority (DDA) land allocated to public institutions such as health, transport and schools. Land for health services such as hospitals, and dispensaries to be set up by the central and Delhi government will be charged at a nominal Re 1 per annum.”
He added, “We consulted the Delhi government in several meetings. We have made land cheaper for public utility institutions for the Delhi government and the Centre’s use. The rates were brought down to the lowest ever by the ministry in consultation with the DDA and the Delhi government.”
“Land for DTC bus depots and DTC offices have been reduced to one-tenth the original commercial market rates, ranging between Rs 6,72,000 per sq metre and
Rs 1,82,400 per sq metre. They have been reduced to the new “No Profit No Loss rate” of Rs 11,745 per sq metre. This will help the Delhi government,” said Naidu.
