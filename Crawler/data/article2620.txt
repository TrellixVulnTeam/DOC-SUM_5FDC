The move comes after the government received some complaints against the app-based taxi service providers Ola and Uber of hiking the fares exorbitantly during rush hours.

The rates were allegedly also hiked, the first full working day of the fortnight-long odd-even scheme when offices, schools and other institutions reopened after an extended weekend.
Transport Minister Gopal Rai made an appeal to the commuters to register their complaints at 011-42400400 against exorbitant fares charged by the app-based taxi service providers.

“If we receive complaints against arbitrariness of any app-based taxi service, we will impound their vehicles,” Rai said.
Earlier in the day, Kejriwal pooled in Rai’s car to reach his office at Delhi Secretariat.
Heavy traffic was witnessed at ITO and near Akshardham in the morning hours on the first working day after the road-rationing scheme was rolled out on April 15.
“Today is the real test of odd-even. Like the first phase of the scheme, we all will have to make its second phase a success,” Rai said.
