'UK will not trigger EU exit process this year' ||||
 A UK government lawyer told a court on Tuesday that Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which formally begins the process of leaving the EU, will not be invoked this year. Earlier, PM Theresa May had said Britain will not start the process until Scotland's position is clear. This comes during court hearings regarding the validity of the EU referendum. ||||

LONDON Britain will not begin its formal divorce from the European Union by invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty this year, a government lawyer told the High Court on Tuesday.
Lawyer Jason Coppell indicated however that the government's current position could change.
"The current position is that notification will not occur before the end of 2016," Coppell said. 
Prime Minister Theresa May has said article 50, which starts a two-year countdown to exit, should not be triggered this year.
Coppell was speaking at the start of the first of a series of lawsuits brought by individuals to demand that the British government win legislative approval from parliament before triggering Article 50.
