Nepal Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli will face the floor test rather than resigning, as he is riding on what he calls “constitutional complexities” to buy time.
Prime Minister Oli, who faces the challenge of proving majority in Parliament following a no-confidence motion brought against him, said at a Parliamentary Party meeting of the CPN-UML on Thursday that constitutional complexities will prevent the formation of a new government, reported the Kathmandu Post.
Citing Article 298 of the Constitution, which reads: “The Council of Ministers existing at the time of commencement of this Constitution shall remain until the transformed Legislature-Parliament constitutes a new Council of Ministers;” Prime Minister Oli insisted on facing the House instead of resigning.
At the meeting, the Prime Minister also briefed his parliamentarians about the latest political situation after the Maoist Centre withdrew its support from the coalition government. He told the lawmakers that “as per Article 298 of the Constitution, (the government) will remain until next parliamentary elections take place”.
