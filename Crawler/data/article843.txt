Rumours were rife that Rajinikanth is still not back from the US due to his ill health and this is the reason that the release date of Kabali might be pushed to August.
Kabali, which was initially planned for a release on July 1 this year, was postponed to July 15. And now, it will release on July 22.
At the same time, Kabali has been cleared with a U certificate with no cuts by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) on Monday.

The film, which will also be released in Telugu and Hindi, co-stars Radhika Apte, Kishore, Dinesh, Kalaiarasan, Dhansikaa and Taiwanese actor Winston Chao.
Tipped to be based on the story of a real life don, Kabali has been predominantly shot in Malaysia. On July 29, the film will also be dubbed and released in Malay.
