Presenting the award, NCP MP Supriya Sule said that Rehman always portrayed the role of a dignified lady in her career.
“Our generation has grown up listening to Waheedaji’s songs. She has always portrayed the role of a dignified woman in her movies who fearlessly faces all the problems in life. In this way, she symbolises every Indian woman who is resilient and tough. The roles played by Waheedaji are always inspiring and exhilarating,” she added.
