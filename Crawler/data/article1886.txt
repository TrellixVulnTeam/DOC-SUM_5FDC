Actress Zareen Khan has denied endorsing weight loss pills and says she cannot endorse something she doesn’t believe in.
“I cannot endorse something I don’t believe in. I work very hard everyday in the gym and believe there are no shortcuts to weight loss!” Zareen said in a statement.

The actress, who can be seen in a sizzling new avtar in the song “Khallas Veerappan” from filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma’s forthcoming movie “Veerappan”, was approached by a weight loss pill company to endorse the product.
She was offered an amount close to Rs.1 crore for this endorsement but she rejected the offer.
Zareen believes in working the hard way and is training under Abbas Ali, who also trains actor Shahid Kapoor.
