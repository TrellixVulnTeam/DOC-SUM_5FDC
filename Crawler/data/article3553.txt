Earlier this week it was reported that the “Quantico” star did not wish to be photographed with the “Jism 2” actress.
Sunny, who is prepping up for director Milap Zaveri’s upcoming sex-comedy “Mastizaade”, where she will perform a double role, said she “feels the same” about Priyanka.
“I feel the same about you darling,” Sunny told Priyanka in a tweet. “Media can be mean sometimes. They just wish it was them taking pics with you. Lol xoxo.”
