Usain Bolt, highlight on the track and away from it too, was a notable absentee from the Rio 2016 Olympics Opening Ceremony at the Maracana Stadium on Friday night. A key member for the Jamaican team and someone who grabs limelight and media attention for whatever he does, left fans and people in the stadium disappointed because he apparently missed the team bus.
Bolt carried the Jamaican flag at the 2012 Olympics in London, where he set the World record, but was too lazy to even be part of the contingent this time around. He shared the information on his Snapchat account shortly before the ceremony was to commence at the iconic football stadium. “Opening Ceremony time but I won’t be there people, all the buses are out,” he said in a quick message.

Later he added that he was too lazy to go anyway despite suggestions by some that he wished to avoid the limelight with many athletes squandering him for selfies. “Looks like the whole squad is out, road movements. One big lazy for me then today, no movement for me,” he later said.

Australia’s beach volleyball player Mariafe Artacho Del Solar said this past week that Bolt gets lots of attention from fellow Olympians which might become too much for him as well. “He was getting bombarded when we saw him this week,” Del Solar said. “I felt like a rookie. The whole team all felt like nothing. But luckily we snuck in a selfie before he bolted.”
Jamaica were led by Bolt’s fellow sprinter Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce into the arena.
