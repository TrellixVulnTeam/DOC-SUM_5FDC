Solar panel scam accused Saritha S Nair Friday told the judicial commission probing the case that she made about 1,000 phone calls to Tenni Joppen, a former aide of Kerala CM Oommen Chandy, and around 130 calls to the CM’s official residence in one year. Joppen was removed from Chandy’s personal staff in the wake of the scam.
Nair made the admission before the commission when its counsel cross examined her regarding details of calls she had made in the year leading up to her arrest in June 2013. She claimed most calls were made to Chandy, who was using Joppen’s mobile phone.
Nair claimed she made 127 calls to Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala’s personal assistant P A Pradosh and met Chennithala to discuss erecting solar lighting solutions in his constituency. She claimed she made repeated calls to several Congress leaders, including K C Venugopal, A P Anil Kumar, Aryadan Muhammed, A P Abdullakutty, Hibi Eden and P C Vishnunath.
She also claimed she had paid Rs 20 lakh to Kerala Police Association in March 2013 as donation for their state conference. The association, she said, had promised to pass a resolution urging the government to install solar panels at all police stations in the state.
Nair also alleged that a part of the money she received from one of the clients of her company, Sreedharan Nair, was given to Chandy as bribe. Nair also submitted on Friday a sealed envelope containing details about the alleged sexual exploitation she was subjected to by state politicians.
