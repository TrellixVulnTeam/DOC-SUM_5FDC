FB Messenger lets users send gift-wrapped texts ||||
 On the occasion of Valentines Day, Facebook Messenger has rolled out a new feature through which users can send gift-wrapped messages. Users have to click on a little heart icon on the app which gift-wraps a message once it is sent. The receiver has to tap on the message to unwrap it. Users can similarly gift-wrap other elements like GIFs. ||||

Facebook has added a new ‘Valentine’s Day’ feature for Messenger. If you’ve tried sending a message on the app today, you’ll notice a little heart with an arrow right at the end. You can send a secret Valentine’s Day message to your love interest after clicking on the icon.
Once you click on heart, Facebook prompts you saying your ‘valentine’ will be gift-wrapped. While it’s a little confusing, just continue typing what you wanted to send and once you hit send, a gift-wrapped message will go out.  The person will also get a gift-wrapped message, and once they tap on it, they’ll be able to read it.


Messenger VP David Marcus also wrote about the feature on his page, noting, “We wanted to make your Valentine feel even more special tomorrow, and help you put a smile on the face of your loved one. So we built the ability for you to gift-wrap anything you send, words, stickers, GIFs, … This is our Valentine special. Hope you’ll enjoy it! Happy Valentine’s Day from all of us at Messenger.”
Ladies please watch out. The Valentine’s Day heart might cause the number of ‘message requests’ from strangers to rise, and you might receive a lot of gift-wrapped messages. Our advice: don’t accept, just ignore.
For the rest of our fellow mortals, who genuinely plan to use this feature to get out of the dreaded ‘Friend Zone’ to enter the GF/BF zone, well, all the best. And if this fails, you can try some of our smart gifting options for Valentine’s Day, because hey who doesn’t love a real gift.
