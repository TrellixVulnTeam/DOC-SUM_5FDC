In a major relief to former chief minister and BJP national vice-president B S Yeddyurappa, the Karnataka High Court Tuesday quashed proceedings in 15 FIRs registered against him by Lokayukta Police in connection with denotification of BDA-acquired land favouring landowners.
The single bench of Justice Rathnakala not only quashed the proceedings, but also issued a direction not to register any case against Yeddyurappa based on the Comptroller and Auditor Generalâ€™s report.
The Lokayukta Police registered 15 FIRs against Yeddyurappa in June 2015 based on a complaint lodged by RTI activist Jayakumar Hiremath.
