Mani Ratnam has released the poster of his next, Kaatru Veliyidai, with Karthi and Aditi Rao Hydari headlining the film. The film's poster was launched on social media minus the fanfare that we associate with such announcements.
The Wazir actress took to Twitter to share the first¬†look of the film.

The film will bring back the evergreen jodi of Ratnam and composer AR Rahman. Ravi Varman will capture the film on his lens and the genre will be romance, Ratnam's USP. Mani Ratnam is producing the movie under his home banner of Madras Talkies.
The mood of the film was captured well on the first poster, which has Karthi and Aditi sharing a moment as doves and a plane fly around them. Karthi reportedly plays a pilot in the film who falls in love with Aditi Rao Hyadari. RJ Balaji has also signed up for an important role in the film.
The film will reportedly begin its 40-day shooting schedule on Friday (July 8) in Ooty. The film is likely to release by the end of this year. The film will be simultaneously made in Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam, according to reports.
