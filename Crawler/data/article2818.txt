Bollywood megastar Shah Rukh Khan has been fined Rs.1,93,784 by the Brihan Mumbai Municipal Corporation for constructing an illegal ramp outside his bungalow ‘Mannat’ in Bandra, a RTI query revealed in Mumbai on Thursday (February 11).
Activist Anil Galgali sought details under RTI on a reinforced cement-concrete ramp constructed outside the actor’s landmark bungalow which was used for parking his vanity van, leading to an outcry early last year.
Following a campaign by various citizens and activists, the municipal commissioner initiated action and a notice was slapped on Shah Rukh on February 6, 2015.
After the notice period ended, the BMC started the demolition on February 15 of the ramp which falls outside the bungalow on the junction of HK Bhabha Road and Mount Mary Road.
Activists had alleged that by constructing the ramp for his private uses, Shah Rukh had also encroached on a portion of public land.
After the demolition, the BMC served a demand notice of Rs.193,785 on the actor as costs towards the razing of the illegal structure, or face prosecution.
In order to close the issue, the actor quietly made the payment through a cheque for the entire amount, Galgali said.
When the ramp came up in late 2014, locals had complained that it blocked access to the famous Mt. Mary Church steps from the Bandstand side where the actor’s bungalow is located.
