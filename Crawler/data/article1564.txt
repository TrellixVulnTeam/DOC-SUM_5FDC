Actor-director Sunny Deol has expressed his desire to make a sequel to his last directorial venture “Ghayal Once Again”.
The film that released earlier this year was the second instalment in the “Ghayal” franchise and besides featuring Sunny in the lead role, also marked his return to direction after “Dillagi” (1999).
“I want to continue with this franchise if someone comes with a good story. I won’t direct this time, rather I would produce the film because it’s quite difficult to direct and act at the same time,” Deol said here.
When asked about his experience of directing “Ghayal Once Again”, the 58-year-old star said, “Direction is much more difficult than acting. While acting the director is there to guide you but as a director you have to work on your own.”
“Ghayal Once Again” will have its world television premiere on Zee Cinema on June 26.
Meanwhile, Sunny has two projects in his pipeline– “Bhaiyyaji Superhitt” and the remake of Marathi film “Poster Boyz”, with brother Bobby Deol.
Sunny is currently working on the Bollywood debut of his son. “Right now, my priority is working towards my son’s film. I’m working that out,” he said.
