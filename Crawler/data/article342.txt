Taking on Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for describing Kashmir as ‘unfinished agenda’ of the United Nations, Minister of State in Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) Jitendra Singh on Thursday said India’s only unfinished agenda with Islamabad is to retrieve the part of Jammu and Kashmir, which continues to be illegally occupied even after 68 years of partition.
Stating that India’s position has always been very consistent and clear, Singh said: “As far as India is concerned, with regard to Jammu and Kashmir the only unfinished agenda with Pakistan is as to how to retrieve the part of Jammu and Kashmir which continues to remain under illegally occupation of Pakistan even after 68 years of partition and independence.”
“And that is also the position stated in the unanimously passed resolution of the Parliament in 1994,” he told ANI.
Singh’s remark came as the Pakistan Prime Minister has vowed to raise this issue at every international platform and provide all sort of support to the Kashmiris.
Sharif made the remarks in Islamabad while talking to the newly-elected lawmakers of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) after his party Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) won majority seats in the July 21 elections.
