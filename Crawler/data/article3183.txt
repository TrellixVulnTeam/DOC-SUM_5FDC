The Delhi government has directed the schools run by it to suspend primary classes in wake of the chilly weather in the national capital and private schools to alter their timings.
While private schools have been asked to amend their timings themselves, directions have been issued to government schools to start an hour later than their usual time.
“Due to the ongoing cold weather and the forecast that the temperature may dip further, it has been decided that primary classes (class KG to V) will remain suspended from Jan 21-23,” a Directorate of Education (DoE) communication to schools
said.
“Morning shift and general shift in government schools will start an hour later than the usual time and similarly evening shift will close and hour before. All private and unaided schools are advised to amend their timings accordingly,” it added.
Yesterday, the Noida and Ghaziabad administration had ordered closure of schools for two days in wake of the intense cold wave.
Dense fog enveloped the city this morning disrupting rail services.
The academic progress at the schools is likely to suffer as the schools had closed down for over 15 days earlier this month in wake of the odd-even trial.
Also, the government had yesterday only directed schools to observe minimum of 222 working days in an academic year.
