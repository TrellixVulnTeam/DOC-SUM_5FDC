Actor Randeep Hooda, who will be essaying the role of Sarabjiit in the Omung Kumar directorial “Sarbjit”, chained himself with heavy handcuffs weighing approximately 2.5 kg in each hand to get into the character.
“Sarbjit” is based on the life of Sarabjit Singh, an Indian farmer who was convicted of charges of terrorism and spying in Pakistan and was sentenced to death.
Actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan will be seen in the role of Dalbir Kaur, Sarbjit’s sister, in the film while actress Richa Chadha will essay Sarabjit’s wife.


“Randeep Hooda has given immense dedication and hard work to his character. While he is well known for his method acting but I believe Randeep has given his entire heart and soul for ‘Sarbjit’. The level of dedication needs immense acknowledgment and it would be visible to others too once the movie releases,” Kumar said in a statement.
As Randeep’s character was trapped in a Pakistan jail for years and given a heartless treatment, the actor made a dummy prison cell in an area of just 6×4 feet where he spent his entire day, fully chained with minimum supply of food intake.
In spite of great irritation and pain, the actor didn’t give up in his self-made training and went beyond his limits to get the realistic performance on screen.
