In a previous tweet on February 12, PM Modi had wished the Afghanistan president on the wrong date sending out warm wishes for a ‘long life, exceptional health and a joyful journey ahead.”
As a response to this faux pas, President Ghani had tweeted back thanking him for his wishes, but pointing out to the mistake in date.
@narendramodi Greetings from Munich Mr. PM. Although, my Birthday is on 19th May, but I’d still like to thank you for your gracious words :)

What followed were a number of tweets trolling PM Modi for getting the date wrong. Many also pointed out to Google being the reason for getting the date wrong.
@ashrafghani Congratulations for your rebirth Sir. @narendramodi

@ashrafghani @narendramodi This is what happens when the internet becomes the ‘source’ of ‘information.’ Happy b’day in advance though :)
