The Central Bureau of Investigation on Saturday arrested present and former MDs of a PSU in a corruption case allegedly involving Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s suspended Principal Secretary Rajendra Kumar.
RS Kaushik, MD of ICSIL and GK Nanda, then MD of ICSIL were arrested by the CBI on Saturday.
The investigative agency today claimed that voice samples from purported “incriminating conversations” caught on tape, linked to an alleged Rs 50-crore scam in award of Delhi government contracts, have matched that of arrested accused Rajendra Kumar, who was Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s principal secretary.
CBI sources claimed that a Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) report has confirmed that the voice in conversations that allegedly support the CBI’s case is that of Kumar, who was arrested on Monday along with four others.
According to the CBI, these are conversations where the Delhi official and other accused in the case — Ashok Kumar, Dinesh Gupta, Sandeep Kumar and Tarun Sharma — discussed the award of contracts by allegedly bending rules to companies allegedly favoured by Kumar.
The purported conversations were recovered from the laptop of Kumar seized during December 2015 raids, said CBI sources. “They are basically audio packets sent by Kumar to other accused in the case. The accused avoided discussing the contracts over the phone and instead sent audio packets by mail,” said a CBI officer, adding that the agency has over a dozen such audio clips.
