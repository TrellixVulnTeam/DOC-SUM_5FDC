Earlier, the NCW chief had sought a public apology from the Bollywood actor and asked for an explanation.
Salman made the comments during an interview with entertainment website spotboye.com to promote his upcoming movie ‘Sultan’ that tells the story of an ageing wrestler trying to make a comeback.
“When I used to walk out of the ring, after the shoot, I used to feel like a raped woman. I couldn’t walk straight,” the 50-year-old actor said earlier on June 21.
