The Congress on Wednesday demanded the immediate sacking of Delhi Police Commissioner B S Bassi, arguing that he has let the force “be taken over by the goondas of the BJP” and made it clear that it will oppose his candidature for the post of Information Commissioner.
Bassi, who is due to retire this month-end, is one of the applicants for the post of Information Commissioner in the Central Information Commission. The selection panel is headed by the Prime Minister, a Cabinet Minister nominated by the PM and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha. Since, there is no Leader of the Opposition in the lower house, leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge has been included in the panel.
“The violence at Patiala House Court clearly indicates that the Delhi Police has been taken over by the goondas of BJP,” said Congress leader Ajay Maken. He said a person in police custody is allowed to be beaten up, while senior advocates who were in the court on the orders of the Supreme Court were heckled and mediapersons manhandled.

“But police was sitting pretty and was not doing anything. Delhi Police is hand in glove with these BJP goondas,” he said.
“The Congress demands that Bassi should be immediately sacked and no post-retirement placement should be given to him,” Maken said.
