BCCI has given its approval for India’s two T20Is against West Indies in Florida on August 27 and 28. The squad for the two T20Is is yet to be announced.
India is already playing a four-match Test series in the Caribbean islands and the team is being led by Virat Kohli.
Team India is playing its first Test series under the stewardship of new head coach Anil Kumble after the former India Test skipper took up the job.
The visitors have won the first Test match with an ease. Riding on Virat Kohli’s maiden Test double hundred, they defeated hosts West Indies by an innings and 92 runs in the first encounter.
In the second clash too in Jamaica, the Virat- Kohli-led India Test side is in a driver’s seat. They have already taken a lead of more than 300 runs in the first innings on day 3 of the second Test before heavy drizzles stooped day’s play and eventually stumps were called early.
India would be looking to wrap up this second match as well with a convincing win if rain doesn’t halt the proceedings.
India last played a T20I series against Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe under the captain MS Dhoni and won the three match series 2-1.
The Men in Blue met West Indies in a T20I during the 2016 World T20 in the semi-final where the Calypso team thumped India by 7 wickets and showed India, exit gates from the contest.
