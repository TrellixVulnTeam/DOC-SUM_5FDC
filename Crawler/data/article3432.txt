Don’t you hate it when you’ve made an online transaction and it takes so long for it to go through, or even the confirmation to come? How many times have you debated with yourself whether you should hit the Refresh button or not, because that ‘wheel’ just kept turning, and turning, and turning?
Well, no matter how irritated you might be, you can’t be as upset as this UK-based couple. Edwina and David Nylan thought they had won a £35 million lottery jackpot in December, only to be told later that they had actually lost out on it because of a glitch in the Lotto mobile app, according to various news websites.
The couple picked out all six winning numbers when entering and paying for the lottery on December 23, but when they called in to claim their jackpot prize, the Lotto operator Camelot told them that they had no record of the transaction. “I am gutted, but what can we do? We have played for years, and had our online account for some time, so it is not as if we didn’t know what we were doing,” Edwina, 55, told The Telegraph.
The deadline for the entry into the lottery was 7.30 pm on December 23, but because of a glitch in the app, the transaction didn’t clear uptil midnight of December 24 — way past the deadline, according to a report in the Mirror.
“It was like all our dreams had come crashing down around us,” Edwina said to SWNS.
