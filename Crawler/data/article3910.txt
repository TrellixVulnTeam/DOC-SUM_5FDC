Govinda today expressed his respect and honour for Supreme Court and its order asking him to apologise to Santosh Rai, the man whom he had slapped in 2008 on the sets of Money Hai Toh Honey Hai.
“I have the highest respect and regards for Supreme Court and the decision given,” said Govinda at a press conference in Mumbai.
The actor, however, remained non-committal on his further course of action. When asked if he would apologies as order by the aspect court or fight the matter legally, Govinda said, “These are technical questions I can answer only after reading the detailed copy of the order.”

Govinda also questioned the intention and real motive of the complainant Santosh Rai in pursuing the case. “If you are saying he is a fan, then show me proof of him being a fan,” questioned Govinda.
The Hero No. 1 actor also expressed his suspicion at Santosh Rai’s mode of funding to keep the case running for seven years now. Govinda also pointed out in his 30 year old career there has never been a similar incident and quizzed the man’s credentials and his real intentions behind being present on the sets in 2008.
The actor however was not forthcoming on his future course of action and said he would decide on technical issues only after getting the copy of the order in hand.
