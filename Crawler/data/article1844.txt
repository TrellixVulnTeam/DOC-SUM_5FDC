First look of actress Charlize Theron from the upcoming “Fast & Furious 8” movie has been revealed.
The 40-year-old “Mad Max: Fury Road” star will be playing the villain in the film.
The picture of Theron shared on the franchise’s Twitter account show the star walking into a gun shop in a ponytail and a Metallica T-shirt.
Action star Vin Diesel also shared details about the actress’ character in the eighth installment.
“Cipher, her character, is forcing Dom in to a place we have not seen. I first imagined her joining our saga back in 2012 when we were filming ‘Fast 6’ in London, but life has a way of dictating when your vision is manifested and this chapter proves to be the perfect time.


“What is surreal is that our kids have play dates while we are on set doing some of the most emotionally arduous scenes in the franchise,” Diesel wrote.
The 48-year-old actor praised Theron and said the team appreciates her coming on board.
“Wait until you meet Cipher, of all her films you have never seen this character she has created… She has truly brought her A game to this saga and we are all grateful for it,” he added.
