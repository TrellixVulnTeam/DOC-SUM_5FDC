India's external debt rose by $11B by March-end ||||
 Indias external debt stood at $485.6 billion at 2016 March-end, recording an increase of $10.6 billion year-on-year, owing to an increase in outstanding NRI deposits, the RBI said on Thursday. However, the increase was partly offset by a valuation gain resulting from the appreciation of US dollar against the rupee. Commercial borrowings (37.3%) remained the largest component of external debt. ||||

MUMBAI India's end-March external debt was at $485.6 billion, up $10.6 billion from end-March 2015, the Reserve Bank of India said in a release on Thursday.
The figure was up $5.4 billion from the $480.2 billion registered at end-December 2015.
The increase in external debt was mainly due to a rise in non-resident Indian deposits, but was partly offset by valuation gains resulting from the appreciation of the dollar versus the rupee and other major currencies.
The share of short-term debt residual maturity to India's forex reserves stood at 42.6 percent of the total external debt at end-March, compared with 38.2 percent at end-March 2015, the RBI said.
