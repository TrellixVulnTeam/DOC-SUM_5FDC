Scores of BJP workers today staged a protest outside Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence here, demanding his resignation over the alleged auto-rickshaw permit scam.
Holding Kejriwal and Transport Minister Gopal Rai accountable for the scam, the demonstrators led by BJP’s Delhi unit chief Satish Upadhyay demanded their resignations. Addressing the demonstrators, Upadhyay said that Delhi’s auto-rickshaw drivers, who gave full respect and support to Kejriwal, today feel cheated.
“It hurts to know that Kejriwal government robbed the permits from the actual auto drivers and gave them to the auto mafia,” he charged.
Upadhyay said people have lost faith in this Government and BJP demands the resignation of Kejriwal and Rai. The protestors raised slogans like “Kejriwal Sharm Karo – Auto Walo Ne Maan Diya, Samman Diya – Tumne Unko Bhi Dhokha Diya.”
Delhi government on Saturday had scrapped more than 900 auto-rickshaw permits in Delhi after alleged irregularities in their allotment. It had also suspended three transport department officials over alleged corruption in issuing fresh Letters of Intents (LOIs) for three-wheelers.
“We have requested LG Najeeb Jung to seek a report from the transport department on the issue and the investigation should be handed over to the Anti-Corruption Branch,” Upadhyay said.
