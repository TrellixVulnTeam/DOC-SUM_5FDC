Actress Preity Zinta, who returns to the big screen after a substantial gap with Bhaiyyaji Superhitt opposite Sunny Deol, says that she is happy to work with her co-star, who is her favourite.
“I am very happy to work with Sunny; he is my most favourite,” Preity said on the sidelines of the shoot of the film with Sunny.
Preity had a guest appearance in Sunny’s directorial Dillagi and then they went on to work in Farz, Yeh Raaste Hain Pyaar Ke, The Hero and was also in Heroes but where they didn’t have scenes together.
About acting with Sunny after a long time, Preity said: “It is not that long ago also, yes, there was a break but I am very happy to be back on the sets and I have always loved the Deol family; they have always been very close to my heart. I used to be scared of him earlier but I am very happy to do this film because it is an enjoyable film.
“After a long time, I am doing a film where I have also enjoyed doing the shots. It is always a pleasure to work with Sunny because he makes life easy as he is not just an actor; he is also a director. He always thinks about the actor, which is very nice and comforting. When I had done my first film Farz, he had taken care of me.”
Bhaiyyaji Superhitt is Preity’s first film after her marriage to Los Angeles-based Gene Goodenough.
About her character in the film, she quipped: “I am characterless in this film. I am just being a little selfish because I am doing a film after some time, so I want the proper promo to come up (before revealing her character).”
Bhaiyyaji Superhitt also stars Ameesha Patel.
