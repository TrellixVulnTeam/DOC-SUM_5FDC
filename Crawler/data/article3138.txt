BJP spokesperson and former MP Shahnawaz Hussain received a threat letter Friday morning, purportedly from the Islamic State, following which the Delhi Police registered a case against unknown persons at North Avenue Police Station.
Police said the complaint was lodged by Hussain’s personal assistant. “We have received the letter and are investigating the matter,” said DCP (New Delhi) Jatin Narwal.
A senior police officer said the letter was abusive and had references to the BJP’s defeat in Bihar.
Hussain told The Indian Express the letter came by post.
“On one side, the letter was typed in English and on other side it was handwritten in Urdu. The contents were abusive and threatened me of dire consequences. At the end of the letter, ‘ISIS’ was mentioned.”
Hussain added that the letter did not just abuse him, but several other BJP leaders. “It abused my colleagues and my party’s functioning style,” he added.
However, he said the letter did not appear to be from someone who knew him as it addressed him as an MP.
“The letter was addressed to ‘Member of Parliament, Shahnawaz Hussain’… It seems the letter is from someone who hates the party.”
