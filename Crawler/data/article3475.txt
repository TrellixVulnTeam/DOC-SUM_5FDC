Commuters travelling in Rajiv Chowk and Kashmere Gate metro stations, two of the most busiest junctions of the network, would now be able to access internet for free with the launch of wi-fi facility on Friday.
The first such introduction of wireless internet in the rapidly expanding network, which has been christened ‘Metro-Fi’, would let people use internet for free for 30 minutes everyday, beyond which they will be charged by the service provider.
The wi-fi services at these two stations are being provided as part of an MoU signed by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation with the Rail Tel Corporation of India in May 2015.
The other three stations where similar facilities would be made available soon are Vishwavidyalaya, Central Secretariat and Hauz Khas. All the five stations fall on metro’s Yellow Line, that connects Samaypur Badli to Gurgaon.
“As soon as a passenger enters the paid area of these stations, she can select available wifi network named ‘Metro-Fi’ and then register herself through her mobile number. Subsequently, one SMS will be sent on that number having the login password,” a metro official said.
Until recently, only trains and stations of the 5.1 km long Rapid Metro Network in Gurgaon were wifi enabled.
