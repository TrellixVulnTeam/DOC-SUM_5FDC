After “24” and “Modern Family”, Bollywood actor-producer Anil Kapoor has now acquired the rights of another American TV series “Prison Break”.
“I always go with my gut feeling. I know people will like it. We will adapt it to suit Indian sensibilities. It’s one of my most favourite shows. I am truly excited,“ Anil said in a statement.
“Prison Break”, which is now gearing up for its fifth season, revolves around two brothers. One has been sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit while the other devises an elaborate plan to help him escape and clear his name.
Sharing more about the show, Anil said: “The show is about sibling love. It has just the right amount of emotions and of course some mind blowing action. In the past, films like ‘Do Aankhen Barah Haath’ and ‘Umar Qaid’, which revolved around jailbreak, have been appreciated by the audience.”


Anil is currently busy shooting for the second installment of “24”.
Will he be a part of “Prison Break”?
“I’d love to be a part of the show but my entire focus is on ’24’ right now. Doing two shows won’t be possible but whoever comes on board has to be physically fit. I have a few names in mind. We will begin casting soon. It will be made on the same scale as ’24’.”
Anil’s production house has bought the rights to season one of “Prison Break”. Season two will be underway only after feedback to the first part is in.
“We’ll start planning the show as soon as I wrap up shooting for ’24’. I want to take it on the floors as soon as possible,” he added.
