Censor Board clears Mohenjo Daro without a cut ||||
 The Hrithik Roshan and Pooja Hegde starrer 'Mohenjo Daro', which has three kissing scenes, has been passed by the Central Board of Film Certification without a single cut. "I guess they (the kisses) came across as they were meant to, as manifestations of pure love. Vulgarity is always in the intention and expression... we never went that way," said Hrithik. ||||

Mohenjo Daro may or may not be historically perfect but it has already got a vote of confidence -- from India's all-powerful censor board. The Censor Board of Film Certification (CBFC) has found nothing wrong with Hrithik Roshan and Pooja Hegde's passionate kisses in the film and shown it the green flag.
India's censor board -- headed by the 'sanskari' Pahlaj Nihalani -- is known for its love of snipping scissors and hatred for long and passionate kisses. A case in point is the last James Bond outing Spectre where Daniel Craig and Monica Bellucci's liplock was deemed too long and snipped by seconds. The Twitter furore -- and jokes -- it led to had not much of an impact on censors.

Hrithik Roshan, Pooja Hegde and Mohenjo Daro are luckier. Despite the Ashutosh Gowariker movie boasting of three kisses, Mohenjo Daro was passed without a single cut. Talking to DNA, Hrithik Roshan said, “I wasn’t expecting any cuts, to be honest. But I am glad nevertheless. As for the kisses being left intact, I guess they came across as they were meant to, as manifestations of pure love. Vulgarity is always in the intention and expression. And we never went that way.”
Mohenjo Daro has been passed with a UA certificate. The Hrithik Roshan period drama will clash with Akshay Kumar-starrer Rustom when it releases on August 12. Hrithik and Ashutosh Gowariker are coming together again after Jodhaa Akbar. Mohenjo Daro marks Pooja Hegde's debut in Bollywood.
