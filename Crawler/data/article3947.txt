Sign language will be recognised as a separate language in Madhya Pradesh and 10 industrial training institutes will be set up at divisional headquarters to give vocational training to the hearing and speech impaired in the next one year. These and other announcements were made by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Sunday to mark the completion of his 10 years in office.
Besides imparting education in sign language to those pursuing diplomas in education (D. Ed) and bachelor of education (B. Ed), the state will bear the fee of hearing and speech impaired students in professional courses, Chouhan said.
To celebrate its government’s 10-year anniversary in MP, the BJP had planned a grand celebration and a training programme in Bhopal for all party MLAs in the country, but decided against it due to the agrarian crisis in the state. Chouhan is the first non-Congress politician in MP to complete 10 years in office.
Chouhan made it a point to invite representatives of all religions and sought their blessings before making his speech. Responding to his felicitation at the BJP headquarters, Chouhan recounted his journey from an ordinary party worker to the longest-serving CM in the state.
“I did not even know how to fill the form when I travelled abroad for the first time. Advaniji filled it for me,’’ he said, adding that at one point, he did not consider himself competent enough to be a successful politician.
