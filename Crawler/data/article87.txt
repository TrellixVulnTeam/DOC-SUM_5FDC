The opening ceremony at the Rio 2016 Olympics is still two days away but the football event is already underway with six women’s matches taking place on Wednesday. And the second match between Canada and Australia has brought the tournament to light.
Janine Beckie of Canada scored in just 20 seconds to put her team 1-0 up after being completely unmarked in the box and slotting home an easy chance. Australia kicked off the game but under strong pressing by Christine Sinclair, the Aussie defence lost the ball and the Sinclair made the most of the lapse with Beckie scoring the fastest goal in Olympic football history – men or women.
Beckie who plays for Houston Dash in America is not new to quick goals even before the other team has time to settle in. She had scored a goal after just 57 seconds when she played for her university Texas Tech.
Just when you think Beckie is one of the players who try and capitalise on early lapses by opposition then she also springs up and scores a 94th minute winner as she did for Canada last month against Brazil.
In the run up to the Rio Olympics, she expressed disappointment at not being included in the World Cup squad but was happy to be part of this “technical” Canadian team.

If that goal wasn’t enough, Shelina Zadorsky was sent off for Canada in the 19th minute for a professional foul which happens to be the quickest sending off in Olympic history. The match is still underway.
Just when you think the drama was over, Beckie missed a penalty in the 73rd minute. But no harm was done with Sinclair scoring the second in the 80th minute to take the game beyond Australia.
Football event began with Sweden beating South Africa 1-0 at the Maracana Stadium.
