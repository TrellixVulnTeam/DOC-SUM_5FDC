Hours after Bhumata Brigade president Trupti Desai entered the Haji Ali Dargah in Mumbai and offered prayers, AIMIM leader Haji Rafat Hussain said he was happy that Desai came to the Dargah, but she shouldn’t have come with police.
Hussain further said, “Trupti Desai should now try and go to a Parsi temple, then we will know if she is fighting for justice or publicity.”
Rights activist Trupti Desai on Thursday entered Mumbai’s Haji Ali Dargah to offer prayers amid tight security, saying her struggle was for gender equality. “At the Dargah, I prayed that women be allowed to enter the inner sanctum, as was the case till 2011,” Bhumata Ranragini Brigade chief Desai said, after coming out of the Dargah.
“Police cooperated with us this time. This is a fight for gender equality. We will try to visit the inner sanctum next time,” she said. Desai and other women activists were earlier denied entry to the Dargah last month.
Desai, however, warned the Dargah trustees of protest in 15 days if women are not allowed to pray where men do. “We saw where we are allowed till and where men go till inside Dargah, in 15 days trustees should allow women in else we will protest.”
