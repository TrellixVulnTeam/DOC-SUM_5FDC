Axis Bank on Friday reported a 21.4 per cent (YoY) decline in its net profit to Rs 1,556 crore for the quarter ended June 2016 because of an 88.7 per cent (YoY) rise in provisions necessitated by a 124.7 per cent jump in gross non-performing assets (GNPAs).
Sequentially, the bank’s profit was down 27.8 per cent. Its net interest income — the difference between interest earned and interest expended — decreased marginally dip and its net interest margin shrunk by 18 basis points.
The top management said the asset quality stress in previously identified pockets continued to get crystallised as majority of the fresh slippages during the quarter was from the ‘watch list’ the bank had created from within its corporate loan portfolio.
While majority of the addition to NPAs from the ‘watch list’ was from usual suspects of iron & steel and power companies, some of it was also from sectors such as education and healthcare, Jairam Sridharan, group executive & chief financial officer, said.
At the end of the June quarter, 46 per cent of Axis Bank’s loan book of Rs 3.44 lakh crore was accounted for by the corporate segment, followed by retail, which accounted for 41 per cent, and the small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) segment, which accounted for 13 per cent.
