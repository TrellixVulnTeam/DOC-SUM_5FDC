Shah Rukh Khan politely distanced himself from the raging Salman Khan ‘raped woman’ controversy that has currently kicked up a storm. Refusing to take sides, SRK opted for diplomacy when quizzed about the Sultan star’s controversial statement, and surprisingly termed himself and some of his past comments inappropriate, owing to which the superstar opined that he couldn’t pass judgement on Salman’s statement.
Said SRK, “In the last few years, I have come to realise that I have made so many inappropriate comments myself. I don’t think I am someone to sit in judgement for somebody else’s comment.”

Elaborating on why not expressing his opinion is not akin to taking sides, SRK said, “It is not about taking a side or not taking a side. I myself talk a lot, so who will sit and judge and decide who should do what. Those who want to do something, they should decide it for themselves. Personally speaking, I don’t think I am anyone to be making a comment. I am so inappropriate myself.”

Last year, SRK’s comments on intolerance had landed him in hot waters so much so that his movie Dilwale too had to bear the brunt of a peeved public. Since then, the actor has been rather careful about expressing his opinion on anything controversial.
