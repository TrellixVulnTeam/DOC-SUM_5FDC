Actress Zareen Khan has been roped in for director Sai Kabir’s upcoming film Divine Lovers starring internationally acclaimed Indian actor Irrfan Khan. The film was initially offered to Kangana Ranaut.
Confirming the news, Kabir said in a statement: “Yes it is true. She fit the bill perfectly as we wanted a girl with Pathani looks.”


Kangana was looking forward to start shoot with Irrfan but somehow the dates never matched and the film couldn’t take off.
Zareen, who was last seen on screen in Vishal Pandya’s “Hate Story 3”, will undergo two months of training which will be overseen by Irrfan himself.
The film is an adventure comedy and shoot starts in September.
Divine Lovers revolves round the lower middle-class section of society and is set in the heartland of India.
