Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday addressed the annual combined commanders’ conference on board the aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya in Kochi.
During the three-and-a-half-hour meeting, the chiefs of the three forces briefed the Prime Minister about the previous year’s performance and the challenges ahead. The meeting was attended by Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, Defence Secretary G Mohan Kumar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval.
The Army Chief General Dalbir Singh, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral R K Dhowan and Chief of Air Staff Marshal Arup Raha have reached Kochi on Monday to take part in the event, which is held outside Delhi for the first time.
Before departing to INS Vikramaditya for the meeting, the prime minister reviewed the tri-services guard of honour at the Southern Naval Command in Kochi.
After the meeting, Modi is supposed to fly to Kollam where he would unveil the statue of former chief minister R Sanker in a function organized by Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam. He would also visit Sivagiri mutt, the spiritual centre of the Hindu Ezhava community, before leaving for Delhi.
