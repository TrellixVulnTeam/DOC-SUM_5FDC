BlueStacks announced that the company has crossed 109 million app downloads with its Android user base becoming the 9th largest globally. It also launched BlueStacks 2, a mobile gaming platform.
BlueStacks 2 spans mobile, PC and TV; and brings with it several new features and a new browser-like interface. With BlueStacks 2, players will now have options to marry gameplay and app discovery.
“When we started, mobile apps, with their crisp resolution looked and sounded gorgeous on PC and TV. What we’ve learned is that the wider visual space lends itself more naturally to app discovery. Once someone discovers apps on PC or TV they tend to use them across all of their devices, giving the BlueStacks platform powerful reach for developers.” said BlueStacks Product Manager, Shashi Kant Sharma.

Also, the browser-like interface gives users an option to click on a ad and view it later without interrupting the gameplay. For people who tend to frequently message in between playing games, BlueStacks can also run multiple apps at the same time in different tabs.
