BCCI president Shashank Manohar has resigned from his post. He had taken over as the cricket body’s president after the demise of Jagmohan Dalmiya in October 2015. This was his second stint as the head of the cricketing body.
He has previously served as ICC president as well.
In a letter addressed to BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur, Manohar said, “I hereby tender my resignation with immediate effect from the post of President of Board of Control for Cricket in India. I also resign with immediate effect as the representative of BCCI on the International Cricket Council, as also the Asian Cricket Council on which I was nominated by the General Body of BCCI. I thank all my colleagues and the staff for their support and cooperation during my tenure. I wish all of you all the very best in taking the cause of Cricket to greater heights.”
Speaking to ANI later, Thakur stated that Manohar is stepping down because the ICC president must be an independent member and hence not affiliated to a body.

A top BCCI administrator told PTI: “We all had an idea that Shashank will be quitting BCCI post. But let’s not get
into a debate as to whether he has dumped a sinking ship or not. Whether it has been prudent on his part to quit when BCCI is going through tough times is a matter of conjecture.”
Meanwhile in the Supreme Court, BCCI was questioned about their apprehensiveness to implement the Lodha Committee reforms.
