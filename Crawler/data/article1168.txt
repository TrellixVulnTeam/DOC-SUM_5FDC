Senior ISIS leaders killed in air strikes: USA ||||
 Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook on Friday said a US-led coalition air strike in Iraq last week killed Islamic State's Deputy Minister of War Basim Muhammad Ahmad Sultan al-Bajari and military commander Hatim Talib al-Hamduni. Cook said the two were ISIS' "most senior military members in Northern Iraq," adding that al-Bajari oversaw the 2014 ISIS offensive to seize control of Mosul. ||||

WASHINGTON A U.S.-led coalition air strike killed Islamic State's deputy minister of war and a military commander in Mosul on June 25, a Pentagon official said on Friday.
"Their deaths, along with strikes against other ISIL leaders in the past month, have critically degraded ISIL's leadership experience in Mosul and removed two of their most senior military members in Northern Iraq," Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said in a statement, using an acronym for the militant group that is also known as ISIS and Daesh.
The strike near Mosul killed Basim Muhammad Ahmad Sultan al-Bajari, the deputy minister of war, who oversaw the militant group's capture of Mosul in 2014, Cook said.
The other Islamic State member killed in the strike was Hatim Talib al-Hamduni, a military commander in Mosul, Cook added.
In June, Iraq's military claimed victory in a U.S.-backed offensive against Islamic State forces in Falluja and set its sights on an offensive against the jihadists who hold Mosul, Iraq's second largest city.
