The Army was called in on Friday in eight districts of Haryana after one person was killed and 21 injured in police action as the Jat protest for quota turned violent and the rampaging mobs set ablaze the state finance minister’s house besides several government and private properties.
Protesters also took some police personnel captive besides going on a rampage at many places including Rohtak, Jhajjar and Hansi, targeting police and private vehicles, buildings housing offices, including two toll plazas at Hansi in Hisar district and near Rohtak, both located on the Delhi-Hisar-Fazilka National Highway.
The agitation, which has been going on for last few days, escalated and turned violent soon after an all-party meeting held by Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar issued an appeal for calling it off. Khattar gave an assurance that a solution will be worked out to extend reservation to the community.

One protestor was killed in Rohtak when the BSF personnel opened fire in “self-defence” after someone from the mob fired at and injured a BSF constable, Haryana DGP Yashpal Singhal told a press conference in Chandigarh. Since the situation was going out of control, the army has been called in for deployment in eight worst-affected districts — Rohtak, Jhajjar, Jind, Bhiwani, Hissar, Kaithal, Panipat and Sonipat, the state police chief said.
About 20 companies of central paramilitary forces (CPMF) have been sought from the Centre, police said.
Today, for the first time, the rail and road traffic on the Delhi Ambala National Highway and mainline railway route was also blocked by protesters at various places including in Sonipat district. A number of trainshave been cancelled.
