The Chief Judicial Magistrate of Lucknow on Monday issued non bailable warrant against expelled BJP leader Dayashankar Singh for his derogatory remark against BSP chief Mayawati. Criticising her ticket distribution system, Singh had compared Mayawati to a sex worker.
The issue also had rocked Parliament and an embarrassed BJP had sacked Singh for the remark. An FIR was also lodged against him on the complaint by the BSP.
Raids were conducted by police to trace Singh even as his family threatened to file an FIR against Mayawati and senior BSP leaders for allegedly using foul language.
Superintendent of Police Manoj Kumar Jha said that raids were conducted on Thursday night but there was no clue about Singh’s whereabouts.
The BSP also claimed that Singh made derogatory references to Mayawati as part of a “planned conspiracy” of the BJP to cover up what was happening in Gujarat (Protests in Una over Dalits thrashing) .
The BSP leaders also abused Daya Shankar and his family for the remark forcing his mother to lodge and FIR against Mayawati.
