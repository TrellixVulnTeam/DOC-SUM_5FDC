Directed by Nagraj Manjule, the film talks about relationship between two young teenagers, who face several challenges before eloping the village.
The “Piku” actor will be hosting the screening for teenagers, including his children, as he feels the younger generation needs to be exposed to great content that is being produced in India.


The screening will be held with guest list including Irrfan and his family, teenagers who are friends of Irrfan’s children and others in presence of the film’s director at a theatre here on Monday, read a statement.
“Every year regional cinema is adding a feather in its cap and undoubtedly this year its ‘Sairat’,” Irrfan said.
He added: “I was moved to see the Marathi ‘Romeo and Juliet’ and truly believe that our teenagers should see the movie, who are exposed mostly to western cinema because this is the phase of new Indian cinema which is bound to become universal and world cinema.”
“Sairat”, a romantic film which released on April 29, is Manjule’s second feature movie, after “Fandry” in 2014, which went on to bag the 61st National Film Award for ‘Indira Gandhi Award for Best First Film of a Director’.
