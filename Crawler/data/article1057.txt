Amritsar Police on Tuesday registered a case against Aam Aadmi Party leader and former journalist Ashish Khetan for allegedly hurting religious sentiments.
The case came up because Khetan, while campaigning for the party ahead of assembly elections in Punjab, compared the AAP manifesto with Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib.
The complaint was made by Sikh Student Federation (Peer Mohammad) leader Karnail Singh Peer Mohammad. He is considered close to Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal).

Case has been registered under Section 295-A at the Civil Lines police station.
 
“In the complaint, I have mentioned that Asish Khetan has disrespected Guru Garnth Sahib, Gita and Bible by comparing these religious texts with Youth manifesto of AAP released on July 3 in Amritsar,”Said Peer Mohammad.

This led to an outrage prompting Khetan to later apologise for his comments. The ruling Shiromani Akali Dal also picked the issue and accused AAP of insulting the holy book.
Earlier, the AAP also had to face flak for publishing a photo of its symbol broom on the manifesto cover which sported a picture of Golden Temple.
The Aam Aadmi Party is actively campaigning in the state for upcoming polls in 2017.
