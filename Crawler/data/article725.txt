Mumbai, July 15 (PTI) Superstar Salman Khan, who was at the center of controversy over his rape analogy, today said he feels sad when his statements are twisted.
The 50-year-old star had stirred up a hornet's nest with his remark that he felt like "a raped woman" after the gruelling shoots of his wrestling drama, "Sultan", which released recently.
"So now should I give you something to survive for the next two weeks? If I don't say anything I am boring. See, I understand your responsibility towards your job. But if I say something my people won't like it. So you guys decide and tell me what you want me to do," Salman said, when asked how he deals with controversies during a group interview here.
Even if he doesn't say anything, things will still be written about him, he said.
"You speak, you don't speak. People will still write what they want to. I may say something, it will be taken as something else.... Phir ek statement ko ghuma firake kya hota hai, you know (You know how a statement is twisted). It's sad."
When asked if he felt he was immune to controversies due to his superstar stature, Salman said, "No, I don't think like that. I believe you are as good as your last film. To me, it's the performance of the last film that matters. The whole cycle begins from there again. Once that chapter ends, another begins."
Salman skipped an appearance for the third time before the Maharashtra State Commission for Women (MSCW) yesterday. He instead sent a letter to the panel in response to the summons issued to him over his 'rape' remarks.
