Though he did not reveal the reason behind the split, the “China Town” actor appeared quite dejected as he also wrote, “Too much has come to light & shown its true colours. Love is never easy and when a certain foundation is broken it’s impossible to move forward.”

Around the same time as Upen tweeted, came 32-year-old actress’ post on her page that read, “When you find no solution to a problem, it’s probably not a problem to be solved. But, rather a truth to be accepted.”
