Another film distributor, Rajesh Thadani said, “The film has opened really well, just as expected. It will make record breaking collection in its weekend which will be around Rs 150 crore.”
Both Rathi and Thadani feel even though Sultan leaked online, it will not affect the business of the Dabangg star’s film.
Manoj Desai, executive director, Gaiety Galaxy and Maratha Mandir Cinema, says the audience’s reactions to the film have been electrifying, but noted that as Eid’s date was shifted, the collections on Wednesday were affected.
“The word-of-mouth for the film is exceptional. Our 1000-seater theatres are almost full, people are clapping and whistling. But since Eid was shifted, it has affected the business. Other than that, everything is going great for the film,” Desai said.
The Ali Abbas Zafar-directed film has opened well at single screens and multiplexes, with ticket pricing at Desai’s theatre properties being at Rs 100-120, while that at the multiplexes it ranges anywhere from Rs 300 to above Rs 500.
