Bombay HC asks state to make school bags lighter ||||
 The Bombay High Court on Wednesday asked the state to ensure implementation of the Government Resolution on reducing the weight of school bags. Schools were instructed to provide lockers, allow students to leave some books at school and use common notebooks for subjects. An expert committee had earlier capped the weight of school bags at 10% of a student's weight. ||||

With the state government informing the Bombay High Court that it has issued a government resolution (GR) regarding reducing the weight of school bags, the court on Wednesday said the state should now look at ensuring implementation.
“Issuing the GR is the first step towards creating a policy. Ensure that the GR is made available across all schools and ensure its implementation,” said the HC. The matter has been kept for March 8.
A bench of Justices V M Kanade and Revati Mohite-Dere were hearing a public interest litigation by Swati Patil on reducing the weight of school bags and for direction to implement an earlier government resolution, which includes making available lockers for children if possible, a single notebook for joint subjects such as Algebra and Geometry, and keeping books for subjects like drawing, work experience, physical education and computers in school.
A committee had been set up to look into this which had earlier put a cap on the weight of school bags – that it should not exceed 10 per cent of the student’s body weight.
