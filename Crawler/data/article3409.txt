Security agencies went into a tizzy after the police control room received a call about a bomb at the Parliament premises this evening.
Several police teams, along with bomb disposal squads, were rushed near Parliament and it was at 6.12 PM that the fire department was alerted, following which fire tenders were rushed there too, said police and fire officials.
Police said it appeared to be a hoax call.
“It was not a mock drill. Somebody made the call and we are verifying it. Investigation is on,” said DCP (New Delhi) Jatin Narwal.
The national capital is on a high alert and security was already stepped up following the terror attack at Pathankot and then inputs received by the police about the presence of two suspected Jaish-e-Mohammad key members here.
Delhi Police Commissioner held a meeting with all deputy commissioners and discussed security concerns in details earlier today, a police source said.
