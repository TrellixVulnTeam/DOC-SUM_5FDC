Vin Diesel has teased fans about his leading lady Deepika Padukone in “Xander Cage Returns”, the upcoming sequel of XXX franchise, by sharing a picture with the Indian beauty on his Instagram.
Deepika, 29, had first fuelled speculation about her possible Hollywood debut by sharing a picture with Diesel where she is seen hugging the Hollywood hunk while looking at the camera mysteriously.
Though Diesel, 48, has left the fans guessing by keeping the picture caption-less, Deepika’s “Piku” co-star Irrfan Khan confirmed the news by congratulating the actress.
“A big congratulations to our favourite #Piku for her smashing #Hollywooddebut with #Vindiesel @DeepikaPadukone,” he posted on Facebook.

There were reports that Deepika had turned down Diesel’s “Fast and Furious 7” to accommodate dates for her 2014 release “Happy New Year”.

“XXX”, a 2002 American action film directed by Rob Cohen, starred Diesel as Xander Cage, a thrill seeking extreme sports enthusiast, stuntman and rebellious athlete-turned- reluctant spy for the national security agency.
