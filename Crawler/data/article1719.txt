Hyderabad, Jun 15 (PTI) Telangana government today said IT and IT-enabled services exports stood at Rs 75,070 crore during 2015-16, up 13.26 per cent from previous year.
In 2014-15, the exports stood at Rs 66,276 crore, Telangana IT minister KT Rama Rao said in a press conference.
"Our aim is to double the exports during the tenure of the present government (by 2019). We have surpassed the national growth in the IT exports which is pegged at 12.3 per cent," Rama Rao said.
"Telangana IT sector generated employment to 35,611 professionals in the last one year taking the total number to 4,07,385 in the state," he said.
The minister also said the state government is all set to launch four sector-specific polices on Cyber Security, Data Analytics, Data Centres and Open Data in the coming three months.
"We have decided to set up India's largest data centre in Hyderabad. A supporting policy for that would be released in the next three months," he said.
Replying to a query, he said the Central government has no "clarity" on the implementation of IT Investment Regions (ITIRs) projects.
He also complained that the Centre is in a "confused" state as to how to go about with the project that was announced about five years ago.
The minister said the state government is in the process of setting up the second phase of the T-Hub on three lakh sqft, housing 900 startups with an investment outlay of Rs 175 crore.
T-Hub is a startup incubator with public/private partnership between the government of Telangana, three of India's premier academic institutes (IIIT-H, ISB and NALSAR) and key private sector leaders.
