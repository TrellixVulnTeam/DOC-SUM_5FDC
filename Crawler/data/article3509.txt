 In a boost to PM Modi's Make in India initiative, the Ministry of Defense has decided to acquire 50,000 bulletproof jackets from two Indian firms Tata Advanced Materials and MKU.

The Defence ministry has decided that Tata Advanced Materials and MKU, the two Indian contenders shortlisted for supplying 50,000 bulletproof jackets, will supply 25,000 such jackets each. The decision is aimed at faster procurement of these jackets for jawans.
The decision to choose Indian contenders to manufacture these jackets is being seen as a great push to the government’s Make In India initiative.
While the final contract is yet to be signed, ministry sources are hopeful that it will be signed “soon”. “The price bids for the project were opened two weeks ago. It has been decided that orders of 25,000 jackets each will be placed with Tatas and MKU. The contracts shall be finalised soon,” said an MoD official.
