No need to agitate on Ram temple issue: Togadia ||||
 Vishva Hindu Parishads international working President Pravin Togadia on Friday said the Ram temple movement is "not a political" issue and his organisation doesn't need to start an agitation as "our brother" (Modi) is in power. Togadia added that the Ram temple can be constructed like the Somnath temple, by passing a law through a joint session of the Parliament. ||||

Softening his stand somewhat on the Ram temple issue, presumably under pressure ahead of next year’s Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Vishva Hindu Parishad’s national working president Pravin Togadia Friday said his organisation will not run any movement for construction of the temple in Ayodhya.
Togadia said the VHP hopes the Narendra Modi government will make way for the temple’s construction by making a law in Parliament.
Speculation had begun that the Parivar, along with other saffron outfits, will revive the Ram temple movement after a fresh lot of stones reached Ayodhya last month. They were purportedly meant to carve structures of the temple’s proposed design.
Addressing VHP workers at Dharma Raksha Nidhi Arpan, an event organised in the state capital to collect donation for organisational activities, Togadia said the Parishad has no role in polls, and the Ram temple is not a political issue. He said that an agitation is launched when an opponent is in the government. But with government of “our brother” (Narendra Modi) at the Centre, there is no need for VHP to start any movement or agitation, he said. Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, he added, does not need to worry.
According to Togadia, the Ram temple should be constructed in the same manner as Somnath Temple was built. “The Centre needs to call a joint session of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, like they were convened on the quota issue. If the Centre enacts a law, the VHP will start building the temple in Ayodhya immediately,” Togadia said.
