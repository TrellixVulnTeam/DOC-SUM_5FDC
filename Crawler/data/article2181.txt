A team of senior Congress leaders Saturday submitted a memorandum to President Pranab Mukherjee, urging him to intervene and order a judicial inquiry in the alleged Rs 19,760 crore “scam” in Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) when Narendra Modi was the chief minister. The Congress delegation, including Ahmed Patel, told Mukherjee that the case involves “squandering of public money, deliberate bleeding of a public sector company, malicious enrichment of private parties and a blatant attempt to suppress truth by intentional mismanagement in the affairs of GSPC.”
