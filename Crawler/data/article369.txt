Did Ranveer just take a jibe at Ranbir? This only he can tell. This is not the first time the Bajirao Mastani actor has taken a potshot at the Tamasha actor.
In an earlier interview, when Ranveer was asked who he felt the Piku actor looked hottest with - him or Ranbir, pat came Ranveer's reply. "What do I think precisely about who she looks hottest with. Me, of course. Yeh bhi koi sawaal hua?"  
Ranveer has always been expressive when it's about his feelings for girlfriend Deepika. The rumours of the two dating started doing the rounds in 2013 when the two were shooting for Bhansali's Goliyon Ki Raas Leela Ram-Leela.
We just want to say, "Boyfriend ho toh Ranveer jaisa, aur agar nahin toh na ho."
