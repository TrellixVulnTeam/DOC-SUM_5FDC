New Delhi, May 23 (PTI) Naseeruddin Shah's memoir "And Then One Day" gives an account of his life till the age of 32, but the actor says he has no plans to write a continuation of his story and would rather bring out a book on Bollywood.
Published in 2014, Shah's biography spans his extraordinary journey from a feudal hamlet near Meerut, to Catholic schools in Nainital and Ajmer and finally to stage and film stardom in Mumbai.
Asked whether he would write a part two, Shah told PTI, "That was to whet the readers appetite. I think I have said all that I had to say. Going beyond this point would mean talking about my marriage, children. I don't feel like doing that. Nor do I feel like talking about movies one after another. It would be very boring. So, I dropped the idea of writing a part two."
The 66-year-old "A Wednesday" actor says he has been wanting to write about the Hindi film industry for a long time as he feels the need to expose the "unreal place".
