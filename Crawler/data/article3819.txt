Five people were lightly injured when a homemade explosive detonated at a bus stop in central Moscow, authorities said today. The device went off yesterday night on Pokrovka Street, a trendy area in central Moscow dotted with bars and restaurants.
“A hooliganism inquiry has been opened,” Moscow police spokesman Maxim Kolosvetov told AFP. Preliminary information suggests the makeshift explosive was thrown either from a car or a nearby residential building and hurt “several” people, another Moscow police spokesman, Andrey Galiakberov, told AFP.
A spokeswoman for the health department of the Moscow city hall said separately that four people received medical attention Monday night and three of them were hospitalised. A fifth person turned to the authorities for help and was hospitalised today, she told AFP.
