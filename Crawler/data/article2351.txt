Delhi BJP President Satish Upadhyay hit out at the Kejriwal government for failing to present the case of diesel commercial vehicle owners before the Supreme Court, which has upheld its decision to ban diesel taxis from plying in Delhi/NCR.
“On the one hand, the ban is going to cause hardship to lakhs of youth working in MNCs and who travel via cabs, and to tourists who rely on cabs to get around the city. On the other hand, vehicle owners and drivers stand to lose their jobs,” said Upadhyay.
The SSC has already banned registration of diesel vehicles in Delhi/NCR. “Owners of these vehicles cannot resell the cars in Delhi. They will have to sell their vehicles outside NCR in order to repay their bank loan. This is a huge loss for them.”
Thousands of commercial vehicle owners had expected the Kejriwal government to request the court to allow them to ply till their installments are paid, said Upadhyay. Back in the 1990s and in 2000, the then government had requested the apex court to grant relief to Blueline bus operators on humanitarian grounds while changing buses from diesel to CNG. The court had considered the pleas.
“Unfortunately, the government did nothing to persuade the court. Due to its pathetic attitude, thousands of vehicle owners are on the verge of bankruptcy. Delhi/NCR will also face an acute shortage of vehicles,” he said.
The party has urged the government to file a review petition and request the SC to allow plying of all diesel commercial vehicles registered in Delhi till their bank installments are repaid.
