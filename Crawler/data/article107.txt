Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel Wednesday met Governor OP Kohli and submitted her resignation letter. Patel announced her decision to step down from the post on Monday, saying she wants to make way for the younger generation in the party as she would be turning 75 soon. Patel’s announcement comes against the backdrop of the Patidar quota agitation and protests by Dalit groups against the flogging of a family by gau rakshaks for skinning a dead cow.
BJP national President Amit Shah will arrive in Gandhinagar tomorrow and meet state leaders to pick Patel’s successor by Friday. The party has appointed Nitin Gadkari and Saroj Pandey as observers. BJP’s Parliamentary Board met today morning at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s residence to decide the next course of action in light of Patel’s announcement. Senior party leader Venkaiah Naidu told reporters that party president Amit Shah, who is also an MLA from Gujarat, is not in the running for the post. With elections due next year, the party will be looking to appoint someone within the Patel community to appease the growing unrest over quotas for Patidars. Gujarat BJP leaders Nitin Patel, Vijay Rupani and Bhupendrasinh Chudasama are reportedly in the running for the top post.
