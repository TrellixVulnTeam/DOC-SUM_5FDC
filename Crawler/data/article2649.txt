Punjab’s drug infamy is all set to be reflected in full glory in Udta Punjab. The just released trailer is uninhibited in its portrayal of Tommy Singh (Shahid Kapoor) a high on drugs rockstar who sings with glee and abuses with impunity while sporting long locks.
Rising young actress Alia Bhatt takes on a de-glam avatar as a migrant Bihari labourer and looks set to shock audience with something different. Her Bihari accent combined with her naivety makes her a treat to watch.

The film is a bold one taking on substance abuse and portraying it in the most real manner possible. The CBFC has been kind enough in retaining the trailer of the movie without any beeps.
With a bevy of A-list actors and producers (Phantom and Balaji Telefilms) collaborating for Udta Punjab, one can hope that they have treated the bold subject in the best manner possible.
