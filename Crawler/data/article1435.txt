Seems like Salman Khan has learnt quite a good lesson from his recent ‘Raped woman’ analogy, hence is choosing to keep things “shorter.”
Hence, when the actor was asked to say something at the International Indian Film Academy Awards (IIFA) 2016 press conference yesterday in Madrid, he said, “Knowing me, the shorter I keep it, the better!”
For the uninitiated, the drama began when the 50-year-old actor, during a recent interaction with a leading webloid shared that he felt like a “raped woman” while portraying the role of a wrestler in his upcoming film ‘ Sultan.’
Within a while, the ‘rape’ metaphor by the ‘Dabangg’ actor disseminated like a wildfire, landing him in a soup.
It came under fire from several women activists who questioned his ‘appalling mindset’ and demanded an apology.
Salman has also been sent notice by the National Commission for Women and Maharashtra State Commission for Women.
Some have, however, termed it as a “miscommunication.”
Father Salim Khan and brother Arbaaz Khan and some other B-Town celebs came out in his defense and that the intention behind the ‘rape’ remark was not wrong.
