Embedded with 24-carat gold and specially selected diamonds, a set of four tyres made by an NRI-owned firm in Dubai was sold for more than Rs 4 crore, setting the Guinness world record for most expensive set of car tyres.
The first and only set of tyres of this kind, the gold-plated tyres were developed by Z Tyres in Dubai.
They were decorated by the world’s most exclusive jewellers — artisan jewellers in Italy — and designed in Dubai, the company said in its website.
The application of gold leafing was done in the UAE by the same craftsmen who have worked on the new presidential palace in Abu Dhabi.
The tyres were included as “World’s Most Expensive Set of Car Tyres” in the Guinness Book of Records, the company claimed.
They were sold for 2.2 million dirhams (USD 600,000 or Rs 4.01 crore) at REIFEN trade fair in Dubai, it said.
The company will donate the money to the Zenises Foundation.
“We’ve always treasured the outstanding skills and dedication involved in developing our Z Tyre range so we thought what better way to celebrate this achievement than with a record-breaking special set of tyres especially commissioned for a unique buyer,” Harjeev Kandhari, Founder and CEO of Zenises which ownes Z Tyres said.
“In keeping with the spirit of the holy month of Ramadan, Z Tyres will donate all profits from the USD 600,000 sale to the Zenises Foundation which focuses on improving access to education across the world,” he added.
