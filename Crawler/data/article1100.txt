Mumbai, Jul 4 (PTI) Having a separate law for Muslims is like encouraging formation of another Pakistan, the Shiv Sena today said, even as it termed the implementation of Uniform Civil Code a "national work" and urged ally BJP to fulfil its poll promise at the earliest.
The Union Law Ministry has asked the Law Commission to examine in detail all issues pertaining to the Uniform Civil Code and submit a report to the government.
"India may have an all inclusive culture, but politicians have wrecked havoc in the name of secularism in the past 60 years. There is a different law for Hindus and Muslims. The truth is, having a separate law for Muslims is like encouraging the formation of another Pakistan," the Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece 'Saamana'.
It claimed that the past governments did nothing to change the situation in the country while continuing with their appeasement politics.
"What is wrong if people today expect you (BJP) to implement the law and make the Ram temple in Ayodhya which you once so desperately wanted when you were in the Opposition?" the ruling alliance partner sought to know.
The Sena said that if the government has referred the matter to the Law Commission keeping in mind the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections next year, it is not good for the country.
"Not withstanding the opposition from Muslim leaders, the government should go ahead with the implementation of the (Uniform Civil) Code, which is a national work. The Modi government has absolute majority. This needs to be respected by them," the Sena said.
The Uniform Civil Code has been a controversial issue and it was the part of BJP's poll manifesto.
