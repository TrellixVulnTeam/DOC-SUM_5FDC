A 23-year-old computer engineer from Chennai, who was trying to enter Syria to join the Islamic State (IS), was deported from Sudan on Thursday, according to sources.
The youth, identified as Mohammad Nasir, had reportedly travelled to Sudan to meet an IS recruiter who was facilitating his journey to Syria. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has registered a case against Nasir, and is set to take him into custody.
According to sources, Nasir moved to Dubai in June this year and was working with a firm there. “It was after he moved to Dubai that he got indoctrinated by online IS propaganda. He came in contact with an IS recruiter who helped him plan his travel to Syria to join IS fighters there. This IS contact advised Nasir not to attempt to enter Syria via Turkey, but to go through Libya,” said a source.
“Nasir bought an air ticket to meet his contact in Sudan — the contact even arranged his visa. By then, Indian agencies had become aware of Nasir’s plans and alerted Sudanese authorities,” said the source.
It is suspected that Nasir also underwent some “training”, sources said.
