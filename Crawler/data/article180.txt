Chennai, Aug 6 (PTI) Veteran director-script writer 'Vietnam Veedu' Sundaram died here today following a brief illness.
Sundaram, 73, is survived by wife and two daughters, sources close to the filmmaker said.

Sundaram earned the sobriquet 'Vietnam Veedu' after he wrote the script for the film 'Vietnam Veedu' starring thespian actor Sivaji Ganesan and Padmini besides Nagesh in the 1970s.
The family drama catapulted Sundaram to fame. He later directed Ganesan in 'Gouravam' where the actor played a dual role of an uncle and nephew, both lawyers.
He also wrote the script for former superstar M G Ramachandran (MGR) starrers 'Naan Yaen Piranthen' and 'Naalai Namathey.'

He had been a recipient of different awards and had also acted in films and TV serials, Jayalalithaa recalled.
"He was an affable man and his death is a great loss to the Tamil cinema industry," she said.
