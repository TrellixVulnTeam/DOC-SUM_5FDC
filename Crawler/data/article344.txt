Did not breach any security: Bhagwant Mann ||||
 Facing enquiry for live streaming a video showing Parliament's security measures, AAP MP Bhagwant on Thursday claimed he did not breach any security. Even television channels cover the Parliament, he reasoned, while simultaneously tendering an unconditional apology. Mann also accused PM Modi of breaching India's security by letting Pakistani intelligence agencies tour the Pathankot attack site. ||||

Aam Aadmi Party Member of Parliament Bhagwant Mann, who has been advised not to attend the Lok Sabha till the enquiry committee submits its report on his live streaming of a video on Parliament House, on Thursday submitted an unconditional apology but reiterated his demand for trying Prime Minister Narendra Modi over Pathankot attack.
In his five page letter submitted to the Ethics Committee joint secretary in Parliament House Thursday morning, he wanted the nine member panel headed by Bhartiya Janta Party MP Kirit Somaiya to summon the Prime Minister for allowing ISI, Pakistani Intelligence Agency, to take a tour of the attack site in Pathankot.
Repeating that he did not breach any security, Mann said even television channels have outside broadcasting vans and cameras to cover the Parliament. He said his intention was just to show his constituency how the parliament functions.
Although, he has sought an unconditional apology for making the video, his attack against PM Modi and his demand to try him may worsen things. Sources said, the PM cannot be called by the committee in this regard as it comes beyond the jurisdiction of the Lok Sabha speaker and the committee constituted by her.
Sources also said that Mann was dragging the Prime Minister unnecessarily into the issue.
