We all agree that Kangana Ranaut is the Queen of Bollywood. The versatile actress has played a plethora of roles but her next is really out of the box — she is playing Praful Patel. The first look of the film landed on Wednesday and the method actor is in her elements once again.
But before we say more, here is Simran’s first look.

The actress is being directed by Hansal Mehta (Aligarh) in the film. The film is titled Simran and is allegedly inspired by the life of an NRI nurse in the US, Sandeep Kaur. She was sent to prison last year for robbing banks to pay off her gambling debts.
While Hansal has kept mum on whether Simran deals with Sandeep’s life or not, he has us confused with the first look of the film. In here, Kangana has been introduced as Praful Patel. So if Kangana is Praful, who is Simran? And while we are it, why use the name of the former cabinet minister?
Produced by Bhushan Kumar and Shailesh Singh, Simran is scripted by Apurva Asrani. The film will start shooting in August in the US.
Kangana would be seen next in Vishal Bhardwaj’s Rangoon, which also stars Shahid Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan.
