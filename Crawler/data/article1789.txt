Guwahati, May 22 (PTI) Sarbananda Sonowal was today unanimously elected as BJP Legislature Party leader in Assam, paving the way for his becoming next chief minister of the state.
In the first meeting of the BJP legislators after the Assembly polls, party MLA Himanta Biswa Sarma proposed Sonowal's name as their leader in the House.

Union Minister Thawar Chand Gehlot, who attended the meeting as an Observer from the BJP central unit, declared Sonowal elected unanimously as the Legislature Party leader.
Thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his support, Sonowal said, "We have the spirit of unity and we have to live up to the people's expectations."
Talking about his meeting with Modi yesterday, Sonowal said the Prime Minister has asked everyone to work honestly for development of all sections of the society.
"He (Modi) said we have got a scope to work for all. He is there for us in our every need. We have to complete the unfinished work," Sonowal said.
He said the BJP winning 60 seats in Assam on its own was "completely unexpected for him".
