Earlier, poll strategist Prashant Kishor, who was roped in by the Congress to guide the party ahead of assembly polls in Punjab and UP, proposed fielding Priyanka Vadra and Rahul Gandhi’s as the party’s CM face; but the idea was soon dropped.
Dikshit is currently embroiled in a water tanker ‘scam’ with the Aam Aadmi Party accusing her of impropriety. The case was handed to the Delhi Anti-Corruption Bureau, who registered an FIR and said she could be called in for questioning.
