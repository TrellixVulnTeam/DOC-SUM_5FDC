New Delhi, Jun 24 (PTI) As the NSG meeting ended with no decision on India's membership bid, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying he has "failed completely" on foreign policy front.
Kejriwal said that the Prime Minister owes an explanation about what he did during his "jaunts" abroad.
"PM Modi has completely failed on foreign policy front. He owes explanation on what did he did on his foreign jaunts?" Kejriwal said on Twitter.
On some media reports claiming that Switzerland too has opposed India's bid to be a NSG member, the AAP leader suggested the development is indicative of Modi's visit to that country earlier this month not bearing fruit.
Switzerland President Johann Schneider-Ammann had on June 6 announced his country's backing to India's membership to the group after holding talks with Modi during the visit.
"Why? Didn't the PM visit Switzerland just a few days ago?" Kejriwal asked.
