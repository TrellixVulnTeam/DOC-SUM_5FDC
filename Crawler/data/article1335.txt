Actor-producer Anil Kapoor, who has tasted success in Hollywood as well, says he is open to do films and TV shows in Pakistan too as sharing love makes any industry better.
“Everyone should work together. I wish to work in Pakistani films and TV shows. Sharing love and appreciation make any industry grow,” he told media at the IIFA Awards green carpet here on Saturday.
During a tete-a-tete with filmmaker Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and US-based Indian actress Freida Pinto at the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) extravaganza here, Anil spoke about how films can cater to the society.
The “Mr. India” star, who has featured in American TV series “24” and Hollywood films like “Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol” and “Slumdog Millionaire”, said: “The more real it is, the better it is. That’s the connect.”
“I know dance and songs are in our culture, but we have great stories to tell and I am sure they will be appreciated anywhere in the world. All these things are very important for films, and the awareness of all these films is important for the world.”
The actor received the Best Actor in a Supporting Role award for his performance in “Dil Dhadkane do” at the awards night.
