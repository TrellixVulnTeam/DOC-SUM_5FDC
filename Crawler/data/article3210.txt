The special NIA court Monday allowed the agency to conduct a lie-detector test on Punjab Police officer Salwinder Singh in connection with its probe into the Pathankot terror attack.
Sources said NIA told the court of District and Sessions Judge Amar Nath that there were “inconsistencies” in Singh’s statements during questioning and sought permission for the test. The sources added that Singh has given consent for the test. The court, sources said, has directed NIA to conduct the test within three days.
Salwinder, currently posted as Assistant Commandant with the 75th battalion of Punjab Armed Police, was shunted days before the terror strike as SP (headquarters) of Gurdaspur and faces charges of breach of discipline. He has claimed that the terrorists hijacked his car before entering the airbase on the intervening night of December 31 and January 1. He has claimed that he was kidnapped by the terrorists after his visit to the shrine and later let off as they did not know his identity.
