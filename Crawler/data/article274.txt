Katihar, Jul 30 (PTI) A CPI(ML) Legislator Mehboob Alam was today booked for allegedly slapping a branch manager of a bank in Bihar's Katihar district.
Rakesh Ranjan, Branch Manager of Gwaltoli branch of Allahabad Bank, lodged a complaint against the MLA for allegedly slapping and abusing him besides trying to forcibly close the branch and creating disturbances in discharging duty, a police official said.
Ranjan had yesterday filed a written complaint to the Superintendent of Police Sidharth Mohan Jain about the incident that occurred at Gwaltoli branch of the Bank on Thursday.
Acting on the SP's directive, the FIR was lodged against two named persons, including the MLA, and some unnamed persons, he said.
When contacted Alam, an MLA from Balirampur Assembly constituency in Katihar district, told PTI "the allegations are completely baseless.
