After eight long years, TRP-spinner Balika Vadhu is finally set to go off air, according to Colors. While the channel was tight-lipped about the reason behind the decision, sources said falling ratings was the reason why Balika Vadhu’s run will finally end.
The channel felt that the show has run its course and it made no sense to drag it any further, according to sources. Also, the show no longer has the same kind of ratings it used to garner previously. The changes of show timing and the jump from one generation to another were reportedly a few factors which affected the ratings of the show.
On July 22, the cast and crew will do their final shoot and on July 31, it will be on air for the last time.
However, the lead actors Mahhi Vij, Ruslaan Mumtaz and others are unaware of the development. “I have not been informed officially about this. It is unfortunate if Balika Vadhu is coming to an end. I wish the show was promoted well as no one knew that it was airing at an early evening time slot. For me, it’s time to move on professionally,” Mahhi was quoted by Times of India.
Her co-star Ruslan Mumtaz told the newspaper that there has been no official announcement yet. He also expressed disappointment.
The show that began as the social critique of child marriage, turned into a saas-bahu drama but without losing any of its dedicated fan base. The show also talked about widow re-marriage and adult education.
Balika Vadhu had made its way to the Limca Books of Records as the longest running daily fiction soap in Hindi, with a run of over 2,000 episodes in May 2016.
