"It's surprising that such Iftar parties are organised by the RSS, but at the same time, not surprising also, because the RSS and the BJP seem to be losing Hindutva agenda," Sena added. ||||

Mumbai, June 23 (ANI): The Shiv Sena on Thursday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of losing the 'Hindutva Agenda' after the Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM), an affiliate of the Sangh, announced plans to host a grand Iftar on July 2, saying it is 'pure hypocrisy' on the part of the saffron party.
"It is surprising that such Iftar parties are organised by the RSS, but at the same time, not surprising also, because the RSS and the BJP seem to be losing the Hindutva agenda," Shiv Sena leader Manisha Kayande told ANI.
"Even the Ram Mandir issue, on which this party rose from two MPs to 181, has now been abandoned by them and they are calling it a cultural program. This is hypocritical on the party's side," she added.
Kayande also questioned the criticism by the BJP and the RSS of the Congress when it had earlier tried to do the same.
Her comments came after the Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM), invited ambassadors from nearly 140 countries earlier this week to attend an international Roza Iftar party at the Parliament House Annexe on July 2. (ANI)
