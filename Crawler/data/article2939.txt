Facebook is giving friendship collages to its 1.6 billion users in celebration of the social network’s 12th birthday.
The collages will be packaged in video presentations of photos of friends and family that have been previously been posted on Facebook.
The photos are picked out by automated technology, although each Facebook user will be able to delete some and select other pictures instead.
The videos won’t be seen by anyone else unless a user decides to share the presentation.


Most Facebook users should start seeing the videos at the top of their Facebook feeds by noon Thursday, which the Menlo Park, California, company is hailing as “Friends Day.” It coincides with the 12th anniversary of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg starting the social network in his Harvard University dorm room.
Facebook says that these ‘Friends Day’ videos stitch together special moments with your friends in a short film that can be edited and shared.
If you have enough content, you will see the Friends Day video on top of the News Feed. People can also see their Friends Day video by clicking “Watch Yours” below a friend’s Friends Day video.
You can also see an option to edit the video, before you decide to share. Once you choose edit, you can pick and choose the pictures you want in the Friends Day video.
