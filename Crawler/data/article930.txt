New Delhi, Jul 10 (PTI) The Delhi High Court has pulled up the municipal corporations here for allowing people to build unauthorised constructions in the city and directed the civic bodies to ensure no such structures come up anywhere.
"There are so many unauthorised constructions in the city. How could you allow them to come up? How can you allow people to make such huge structures?" a bench of Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice Sangita Dhingra Sehgal asked the civic bodies.
The bench directed them to "ensure no such unauthorised constructions come up anywhere in the city" and disposed of a PIL by a south Delhi resident for demolition of unauthorised constructions.
In their defence, the corporations contended that they have been periodically taking action against unauthorised constructions by issuing show cause notices and sealing them, but the people responsible for building such structures keep raising new ones.
