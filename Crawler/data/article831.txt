Following backlash on social media over ‘Shaktiman’ being given more importance than the cops who lost their lives, the Uttarakhand Government has removed the statue of the police horse installed at the Police Lines.
“The statue was here till last evening. Today morning when I came here, it wasn’t here. It was a horse statue. I don’t know where did it vanish,” a local resident told ANI.
Chief Minister Harish Rawat was supposed to inaugurate the ‘Shaktiman Park’ named after the police horse, who was critically maimed in a BJP rally carried out by MP Ganesh Joshi earlier on March 14.

Shaktiman was a well-trained 13-year-old horse of the Uttarakhand Mounted Police.
When the horse was deployed by the police during a BJP rally, Joshi had allegedly attacked the horse’s leg with a baton, critically injuring the animal. The outrage over this incident of gross animal abuse grew so large that Joshi was briefly arrested.
The white-coloured Kathiawari horse succumbed to its injuries on April 20.
