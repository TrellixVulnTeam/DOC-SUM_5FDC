Arijit Singh... who is that: Salman Khan ||||
 Following a question on singer Arijit Singh, actor Salman Khan responded by asking, "Who is that?" Earlier, reports claimed that Salman had ensured that Arijit's song was dropped from his film 'Sultan', following which Arijit issued a public apology. Salman added, "When such smart comments and posts happen, you get to know with what intention they are writing it." ||||

Salman Khan certainly has no love lost for Arijit Singh. So much so that he refuses to acknowledge the singer’s existence, and much of that has to do with the latter’s Facebook post where he pleaded for Salman’s forgiveness and repeatedly beseeched him to retain his (Arijit’s) voice in Sultan. Of course, that was not meant to be and Arijit’s version was replaced by that of Pakistani singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan. When Salman was asked about the Arijit Singh controversy, the superstar smirked, “Who is that?”

When scribes repeated the question, Salman once again feigned ignorance before finally replying,”Acha that singer.”
Commenting on the episode, Salman said, “In every movie, there are lot of singers who get replaced. People come and sing and it’s the director and producer who make the choice of who is going to be the best voice for the film. One voice was mine as well but that was also rejected. There is no need to get so upset and so hurt. This is life.”
Taking a subtle dig at Arijit’s public apology through a Facebook post, Salman said, “There should be a day when one person should say I don’t want to sing for him and then other one should say, ‘arre please gaa de mere liye. I am sorry.’ And then smart ones don’t turn out bright. When such smart comments and posts happen, you get to know with what intention they are writing it. So it is all good.”
