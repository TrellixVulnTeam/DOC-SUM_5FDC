Microsoft’s latest commercial released just ahead of the Christmas holiday season, features a special surprise: rival tech company Apple.
Microsoft’s video shows employees from the company’s store, chosen from across US, who come together at the newly opened 5th Ave Store in New York to spread some holiday wishes.
They are joined by a local NYC children’s youth choir, and together the group walks down to the Apple store. The song they are singing: Let there be peace on earth, which is well apt for the occasion if you’re going to stand outside your rival firm’s store.
As the choir and Microsoft employees continue singing, Apple store employees come out and in the end the two groups hug it out.
Of course, this is not the first time that we’ve seen Apple and Microsoft come together in the recent past. At the September launch of the new iPhones and the new iPad Pro, Apple had sprung a surprise addition to its list of speakers with Microsoft’s Kirk Koenigsbauer making an appearance to talk about the productivity side of the iPad Pro.
Now the latest ad from Microsoft, makes it appear like that this wasn’t a one-time event.
