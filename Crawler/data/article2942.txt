Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday petitioned the Supreme Court challenging the Delhi High Court order refusing to quash summons issued against them by trial court in National Herald case.
Journalist Suman Dubey and Sam Pitroda have also moved the Supreme Court in the National Herald case.
The Delhi High Court had observed that the “actions of a political party” had “wider ramifications” and the issue under consideration was not a “mere commercial transaction”.
Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Sonia, argued that the cash loan to AJL by Congress was money that was donated to the party, and it was free to use the funds as it pleased. He also argued that “outsiders” could not raise questions regarding the use of party funds. The party could have also written off the loan, he added.
