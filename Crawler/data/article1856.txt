LASHKAR-E-TOIBA OPERATIONS commander Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi and six others accused in the 2008 Mumbai attack case will be individually charged for the abetment to murder of each of the 166 people who died in the carnage, a Pakistani anti-terrorism court ruled on Friday.
“The seven suspects will be charged individually for the abetment to murder of each victim of Mumbai attack case,” a senior court official said, quoting the verdict of the trial court. The official told PTI that the court, however, did not allow cross examination of the suspects in this regard.
The prosecution had filed an application in the ATC Islamabad some two months ago requesting it to make amendment in the charges against the suspects in abetment to murder of each individual in the carnage. pti
