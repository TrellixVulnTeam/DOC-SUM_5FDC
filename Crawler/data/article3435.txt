The Axis Vidius is world’s smallest quadcopter with camera equipped for a first person view drone footage. The drone itself is a square of dimensions not bigger than 1.5 inches that can astonish everyone with its livestream and video recording ability.
The Axis Vidius weighs under 0.55 pounds and its users don’t need to register with Federation Aviation Administration (FAA). Axis Drones calls its Vidius model to be the world’s smallest drone fitted with a video camera.
The Axis Vidius has a flight time of around five to seven minutes on a 20-minute USB charge. The pilots of Axis Vidius can stream their live video feed via WiFi. Even though Axis Vidius can be controlled via a smartphone, the Axis Vidius also comes with a 2.4 GHz controller for piloting the drone.
The Axis Vidius comes with a 6-axis gyro stabilisation and can do 360 degree flips and rolls while streaming videos. The world’s smallest drone records video in 420p resolution which may not sound exciting for many.
The Axis Vidius is also equipped with LED lights for night time flying. The drone is available for preorder for $75 before January 7 and is expected to ship on or before January 29.
