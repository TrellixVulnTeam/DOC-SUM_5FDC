The crisis in Arunachal Pradesh Congress, which resulted in imposition of President’s Rule, appears set to blow over. The Congress dissidents, who had raised a banner of revolt against then chief minister Nabam Tuki, on Sunday expressed hope that a resolution was in sight.
Dissident MLAs led by Kalikho Pul had a meeting with Rahul Gandhi last week during which they are learnt to have clarified that they do not intend to leave the party. Gandhi, in return, assured them that he would resolve the problem soon, sources said.
Reiterating their demand for a leadership change in the state, the dissidents reportedly gave Rahul details about corruption allegations against Tuki.
Pul said the state is facing a financial crisis due to mismanagement, resulting in the government going for overdraft for the last three consecutive years. “We only want a leadership change to save the party,” Pul told The Indian Express. “We are not going anywhere. We are with the Congress, and will remain with the Congress.”
The dissidents are now expecting a meeting with party president Sonia Gandhi.
