Dilwale was co-produced by Red Chillies Entertainments Pvt. Ltd. and Rohit Shetty. While the majority of the screens were in traditional markets–North America (the US and Canada), the UK and West Asia, Dilwale also released in new territories like Jordan, Spain, Finland, Trinidad and Guyana.
Dilwale is all set to release in Germany, Iraq, Palestine, Peru, Switzerland, Morocco, Austria and Egypt in the coming weeks.
“Shah Rukh Khan’s popularity in the international circuit makes it possible to explore new territories. Ideally, around 85-90 per cent of the foreign collection comes from traditional markets. However, in case of Dilwale, we notice the new or non-traditional markets’ contribution at 30-35 per cent. This has helped expand the scope of the international performance for the film,” says Gaurav Verma, Chief Revenue Officer, Red Chillies Entertainments Pvt. Ltd.

South East Asian markets like Malaysia and Indonesia are also contributing well to the foreign collection, he adds. The film’s headline song, Gerua, was dubbed in Malay to familiarise audiences. It was the top song on iTunes in Malaysia around the release.
