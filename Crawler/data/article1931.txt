Senior IPS officer Satish Verma, who was a member of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) that probed the Ishrat Jahan encounter case, has been served a showcause notice by Shillong-based North Eastern Electrical Power Corporation (NEEPCO) — where he is currently posted — for alleged misconduct and unauthorised absence from duty.
Sources said the Home Ministry, which is the cadre-controlling authority for IPS officers, has been informed of the notice issued by NEEPCO, which comes under the Power Ministry.
Verma has been asked to explain the absence from duty and travelling without permission, sources said.
When contacted, Verma said, “I do not wish to make any comment on this.”
Verma was part of the three-member SIT appointed by the Gujarat High Court to probe the Ishrat case, and had taken a different stand from the other two members. He had filed an affidavit in the High Court that the encounter could have been staged, and also cast doubts over Ishrat being a Lashkar terrorist.
