Chennai, Jun 27 (PTI) Madras High Court Advocates Association today decided to abstain indefinitely from all courts and tribunals from tomorrow demanding unconditional withdrawal of recently amended rules to the Advocates Act, which among others provided for disciplinary action against erring lawyers.
An Extra Ordinary General Body Meeting of MHAA presided over by vice-president K Gini Manuel decided on a series of protests including to abstain from the courts indefinitely, MHAA office-bearers said.
It was also resolved to conduct a "Rail Roko" on June 29 here and "burn the draconian rules" on July 1 near the court complex.
The meeting also demanded that the Bar Council of India and Bar Council of Tamilnadu and Puducherry revoke forthwith the suspension of the advocates facing disciplinary proceedings on various charges.
The high court last month issued a notification making amendments to existing rules under the Advocates Act with a view to ensuring peaceful conduct of court proceedings and suggesting disciplinary action to be taken against erring advocates.
As lawyers protested against the amendments, Chief Justice S K Kaul later said he would not act against lawyers in pursuant to the amended rules, but he could not prevent BCI from proceeding against bar associations if they continue agitation.
