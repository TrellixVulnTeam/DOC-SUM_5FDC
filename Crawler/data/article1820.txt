Exempt pulses from VAT: Centre to states ||||
 The Union government on Saturday urged the states to exempt pulses from VAT, mandi tax and other local levies for bringing their prices down 5% to 7%. Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said that pulse prices are rising because of the increasing demand-supply gap, with the annual output being 17 million tonnes in 2015-16 and consumption being 23 million tonnes. ||||

The government on Saturday urged the states to exempt pulses from value added tax (VAT), mandi tax and various other local levies for bringing down their prices by 5% to 7%.
Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said prices of pulses have been rising because of increasing gap between demand and supply. He said the country’s annual pulses output has increased from 14 million tonne (MT) in 2006-7 to 17 MT in 2015-16 while consumption during the same period has increased sharply from 16 MT to 23 MT.
Paswan said many traders hoard pulses in the bordering areas of the state where stock limits are not imposed.
“There should be a logical and scientific formula for stock limits separately in consuming states and surplus states limits and also for millers, producers and importers so that supply chain mechanism remains smooth and pulses are available at reasonable prices,” Paswan said.
