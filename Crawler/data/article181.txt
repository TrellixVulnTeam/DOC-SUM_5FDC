According to Variety, the Pitch Perfect actor will take on one of the leads in a contemporary retelling that will see two female con artists, one high-class, the other low-rent, try to scam a tech prodigy out of his fortune.
Wilson is also set to produce alongside Roger Birnbaum, who has been behind the remakes of RoboCop, in 2014, and The Magnificent Seven, due for release in September. Wilson is also attached to a remake of the Goldie Hawn comedy Private Benjamin.
The original Dirty Rotten Scoundrels starred Michael Caine and Steve Martin as two competing conmen working on the French Riviera. It was itself a remake of the 1964 comedy Bedtime Story, starring Marlon Brando and David Niven. It was also adapted into a successful musical, starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz.
It marks the second gender-swapped remake to be announced this week, after news hit that Channing Tatum would be playing a mermaid in a new version of Splash.
