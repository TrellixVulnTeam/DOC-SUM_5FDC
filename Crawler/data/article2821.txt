The Railway Ministry has approached celebrity chef Sanjeev Kapoor to prepare the menu of food items that are served on trains. Kapoor, who has decades of expertise in commercial food and beverage industry, is a household name in the country, which is why the Railways asked him to prepare the menu, said senior officials in the ministry.
“I won’t be able to reveal much, but yes as an Indian I’m glad to be able to help Indian Railways,” Kapoor told The Indian Express.
Asked if the quality of food can be ensured within the low price points of rail catering, he said: “Take for example gol gappas. They are tasty even though they are not expensive.”
Kapoor has undertaken similar exercise with large organisations and has a clear idea of the challenges, an official said.
