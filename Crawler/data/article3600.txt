Vehicle drivers found guilty of using forged licence plates, during the trial period of the Delhi government’s odd-even scheme from January 1-15 next year, will face charges of cheating, warned Transport Minister Gopal Rai Tuesday.
“If anyone is caught using fake number plates to violate the odd-even scheme, an FIR will be registered against them on charges of cheating. A hefty fine will also be imposed. I request everybody not to indulge in forgery of any kind,” Rai said while flagging off events to mark the capital’s third car-free day.
Rai also launched a more sophisticated version of the PoochO App, which will help commuters get in touch with autorickshaw drivers and taxi drivers. As many as 15,000 autorickshaw drivers were already registered on the app, said the minister.
“You will find phone numbers of autorickshaw drivers, who are near your locality, on the app. You can call them for a pick- up,” said the minister.
The app, developed by the Delhi Integrated Multi-Model Transit System (DIMTS), was launched by the Delhi government in July last year. The app can be downloaded on Android phones and commuters can use GPS on their cell phones to find an autorickshaw.
On Monday, the Delhi government had announced that a fine of Rs 2,000 will be levied on vehicles found flouting the odd-even rule.
The government will announce the rest of the policies and rules pertaining to the odd-even formula later this week.
