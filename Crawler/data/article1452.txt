More than 25% excess rainfall over normal on Wednesday has pulled down the overall deficiency in the quantum of monsoon rainfall to only 18% from 25% reported a week ago.
With monsoon rains expected to advance further into parts of northern and western regions in the next couple of days, overall deficiency would fall further, an India Meteorological Department (IMD) official on Thursday said.
“The conditions are favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon into remaining parts of west Madhya Pradesh, west Uttar Pradesh, most parts of Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Punjab and some parts of East Rajasthan during next three to four days,” IMD said its latest bulletin. The IMD has stated that the average quantum of rainfall during June 1–June 22 has been 85.5 mm against the normal range of 103.8 mm, thus making it 18% lower than the benchmark.
However, a Met department official said that the monsoon had entered the Kerala coast only on June 8, against the usual date of June 1.
According to IMD, out of 36 sub-divisions in the country, six have recorded excess rainfall and 17 pockets had normal rains. Eleven divisions got deficient rainfall while only two received scanty rainfall. With the exception of Gujarat, Rajasthan and parts of Odisha and Jharkhand, all other regions across the country has received more than normal monsoon rainfall till now.
According to the forecast of private agency Skymet, the first half of the next week will continue to see good monsoon rain activity in coastal Karnataka, Konkan and Goa, northeast India and the foothills of the Indo-Gangetic plains.
