Srinagar, May 22 (PTI) Internet services were suspended in Kupwara district of Kashmir today as authorities apprehended misuse of social media in the wake of killing of five militants in an encounter yesterday over which there have been protests by some locals.
"The internet services in the (Kupwara) district have been suspended since midnight as a precautionary measure," a police official said.
He said the step was taken to prevent elements inimical to peace from using the killing of the militants for fuelling anti-state protests.
Five militants were killed yesterday in an encounter with security forces in Kupwara district of north Kashmir that also left two soldiers injured. One of them succumbed to injuries today.
The militants killed in the encounter yesterday were laid to rest today in a local graveyard where hundreds of local residents participated in their last rites.
