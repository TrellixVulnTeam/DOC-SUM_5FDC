For Xiaomi the Mi 5 launch comes at a time when it is facing increasing scrutiny from investors, especially after the world’s most valued start-up missed its own sale target. Xiaomi shipped around 70 million smartphones in 2015, well below its own 80 million forecast.
Xiaomi had estimated total annual sales of 80-100 million, but then in July reported semi-annual sales that for the first time were lower than the previous six months, with analysts saying its main domestic market was rapidly becoming saturated.
No doubt with the Xiaomi Mi 5, the expectations will be high from the company.  We’ll have to wait till February 24 to see if the leaks have got it all right.
