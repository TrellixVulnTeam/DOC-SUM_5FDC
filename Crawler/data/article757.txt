French President Francois Hollande in his speech has condoned the terroirst attack in the city of Nice, in France, that has claimed 77 lives and left 100 wounded.
Reports suggest that a lone attacker (a French man of Tunisian decent) drove a tuck throught the crowds who had just watched a fireworks display on seafront in the city.
French President Francois Hollande said “the terrorist character” of the Bastille Day truck attack in Nice cannot be denied.
Hollande confirmed that 77 people, including some children, were killed when the truck drove through the crowds who had just watched a fireworks display on seafront in the city. He said 20 wounded people are in critical condition.
Just hours after announcing in the traditional Bastille Day interview that the state of emergency, in place since November attacks that killed 130 in Paris, was to be removed, Hollande said it must be extended for three months. That decision will need parliamentary approval.
He also said other measures will be put in place to counter the threat.
