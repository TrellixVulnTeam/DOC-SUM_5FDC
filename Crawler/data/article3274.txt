Pakistan government’s plan to make Gilgit-Baltistan the fifth province of the country has drawn criticism from Hurriyat chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani.
Calling Gilgit-Baltistan an integral part of J&K, he termed the plan a “violation of the UN resolutions” on Kashmir. He also called it a “betrayal” of Kashmir by Pakistan. “The entire state of J&K, falling on both sides of the ceasefire line, is a disputed territory…There is no constitutional or moral justification for deciding on any part of the territory without consent of its people. This is also a clear violation of UN resolutions on Kashmir,” he said Wednesday.
He also cautioned Pakistan, saying that the “act will harm the disputed nature of J&K” and also serve as a certificate to India for its “occupation” of the state.
While insisting that he was not opposed to economic development, he said creating trade routes at the cost of rights, wishes and sacrifices of Kashmiri nation was an injustice and against the traditional and national Kashmir policy of Pakistan.
“Until a referendum is held in the entire state under the supervision of the UN, no separate decision will be taken about this part…It will be a betrayal with the Kashmiri people and their sacrifices.” On the proposal of developing trade and travel relationship between Pakistan, Iran, China and Central Asian countries, he said that until these countries mutually solved their political issues through talks, there was a feeble chance of development in their trade and travel relations.
