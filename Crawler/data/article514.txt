Guess there is no respite for Shah Rukh Khan and his upcoming films. After the fracas surrounding the clash between Shah Rukh Khan's upcoming film Raees and Hrithik Roshan-starrer Kaabil on January 26 next year, now it seems like Shah Rukh's film with Alia Bhatt, Dear Zindagi has the same release date as that of Sujoy Ghosh's Kahaani 2.

However, Vidya Balan back in March tweeted a text-based teaser of Kahaani 2 which announced November 25 as the release date. The film is the sequel to the surprise blockbuster of 2012 Kahaani and while it is not known whether the original supporting cast is returning for the sequel or not, actor Arjun Rampal will be playing a meaty role in the film.

On Wednesday (July 20), Kaabil director Sanjay Gupta tweeted that the release date of his film remains unchanged. Thus, as of now, Kaabil and Raees, until any further announcement of release date changes, are both slated to release on July 26.
