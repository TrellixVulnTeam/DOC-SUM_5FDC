“I’m thrilled and honoured by the recognition I have received from the country that I love with all my heart. France has been an inspiration always. I now live between Paris and Delhi and for me France is literally my own country. I hope to keep getting inspired by France, the beauty and elegance of the French people,” said Arora at the investiture ceremony at the French embassy here.

Pinning the insignia on the celebrated designer, Richier said: “Manish has a long-standing connection with France, which is like a second home for him. He is a pioneer in bringing the fashion culture of both countries together with his exuberant imagination. I am delighted to confer this high honour on him.”
