If Varun Dhawan and John Abraham coming together in one film was not enough, we have got some additional eye candy in Dishoom. We are talking about a buffed and chiselled Akshay Kumar with a man-bun to boot — and that’s just Dishoom’s first look of the actor.
Yes, Akshay is making a cameo in the Varun-John-Jacqueline Fernandez-Akshaye Khanna film. While the news was out last year that Akshay will be playing an important role in this buddy cop film, his look is sending our interest levels soaring.
The man himself comes riding a jet-ski and by his own admission, Akshay had a ball shooting for this cameo. Just going by the look alone, we give full marks to the makers of Dishoom for trying something new. Man-bun is all the rage and we have seen Leonardo DiCaprio sporting it, even Shah Rukh Khan when he is not working.

Akshay tweeted his look, saying, “A cameo I had a ball shooting.Wishing all the luck to my friends Sajid,John,Varun & Jacky!Pack a punch with #Dishoom.” The actor is also readying for his next release, Rustom, which will release in August.

Earlier, prominent Hindi film producers and studio representatives met to ensure Dishoom is not leaked online like Udta Punjab and Sultan. They have now decided to submit the film in encrypted format to CBFC for censoring.

“The producers of John Abraham and Varun Dhawan-starrer Dishoom are in the process of obtaining ‘John Doe’ order (order against anonymous entities) from the Bombay high court, directing Internet Service Providers (ISPs), Telecom Operators and other platforms to ensure that any illegal content from ‘Dishoom’ is not made available on their services,” Mukesh Bhatt, President of the Film and Television Producers Guild of India, said in a statement.
