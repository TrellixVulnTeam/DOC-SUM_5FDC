A collection of King of Pop Michael Jackson’s drawings is to go up for sale.
Joseph McBratney claims to have privately amassed over 100 drawings by the late “Thriller” hitmaker – who died in June 2009 aged 50 – including sketches of The Beatles, the late Princess Diana, Abraham Lincoln, Charlie Chaplin among others, reported the New York Post.
“It’s a big responsibility, I put this collection together. (I want to create) a non-profit endowment to help kids. It would be a shame for this beautiful property to be anything else but a healing property for suffering kids and adults who would never have the chance to be in recovery or treatment,” he said.
McBratney, who has also been known as Joe Brat, first began collecting the drawings after buying some of the “Billie Jean” star’s memorabilia on eBay, and was when directed to a Mexican woman by a dealer, who didn’t speak English but said she’d acquired a number of the sketches while working for Sony.
All the pictures are signed by the star and the collector said he has had them authenticated by an autograph authentication service.
McBratney also wants to stage an exhibition of the drawings.
