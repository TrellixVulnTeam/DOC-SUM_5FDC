Goa police issued summons to musician and singer Remo Fernandes on Saturday, a day after he “verbally abused” a 17-year-old accident victim at the Goa Medical Hospital (GMC).
According to police, the girl was injured by a car allegedly driven by Remo’s son Jonah Fernandes near Bodgini Temple in Mapusa on December 1.
“The singer entered ward number 105 of Goa Medical Hospital on Friday between 3pm and 4pm and verbally abused the girl,” the minor’s lawyer, advocate Aires Rodrigues, said in his complaint.
The Agacaim police have filed a case under the Goa Children’s Act against the singer. “There seemed to be an altercation between the girl, her family and Remo, during which the singer used abusive words against the 17-year-old. We issued summons to Remo to appear Monday,” Inspector Jivba Dalvi said.
On Friday, an FIR was registered against the 62-year-old singer under Section 8 R/W 2 (m) of the Goa Children’s Act. Police officials at Mapusa station said that a “parallel investigation is under way against Jonah Fernandes”.
“The victim has serious injuries, it will take some time for her to recover. We have registered a case under IPC Section 279 (rash driving) and Section 338 (causing grave injury, endangering life or personal safety of others) and will continue with the probe,” said a police official.
On the summons, Remo said, “Both complaints are total lies, fabricated by a person who wishes very hard to malign me.”
