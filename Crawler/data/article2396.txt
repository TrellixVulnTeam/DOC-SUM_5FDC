Aditya Pancholi was certainly not amused after Adhyayan Suman used the former’s name with glee in his explosive interview where he ran down his ex-girlfriend Kangana Ranaut in glowing terms. In his interview, Adhyayan makes references Aditya more than once and portrayed the latter as the man who warned him to stay away from Kangana.
When IndianExpress.com got in touch with Aditya, the actor politely excused himself from getting dragged or commenting on the issue. Instead he had only praises for Kangana and told us he has tremendous respect for whatever she has achieved in her career today on her own merit.

At a late night special screening of Baaghi when Aditya was quizzed by reporters about Adhyayan’s interview, an angry Aditya remarked, “Who Adhyayan? Who is he? Bring him here.” Saying so, Aditya rolled the windows of his car up and drove off.
We are sure Adhyayan certainly wouldn’t want to come face-to-face with Aditya anytime soon.
