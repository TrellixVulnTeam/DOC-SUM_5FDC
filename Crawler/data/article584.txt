Gary Marshall, the director of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts-starrer Pretty Woman, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Burbank, Los Angeles following complications from pneumonia after suffering a stroke. He was 81 at the time of death.
BREAKING: Publicist: 'Happy Days' creator and 'Pretty Woman' director Garry Marshall dies at 81.
Besides directing the blockbuster romantic comedy Pretty Woman which earned over $ 463m worldwide, he also created the hit 1970s television series Happy Days, and later directed films like Runaway Bride (1999) and The Princess Diaries (2001).
 
Much before Marshall made a name in the showbiz industry, he began his career in the 1960s selling jokes to comedians. He then moved on to write sketches for The Tonight Show with Jack Paar in New York.
In a 1980s interview, Marshall said, "�??In the neighborhood where we grew up in, the Bronx, you only had a few choices. You were either an athlete or a gangster, or you were funny."
Marshall got his big break in the 1960s when he joined the Dick Van Dyke Show as a writer. In 1971, he wrote the Happy Days pilot, which debuted as a series in 1974 and became the popular US television show in 1976. The series ran for ten years till 1984.
In fact, Marshall is credited with inventing the phrase "jumping the shark", which entered dictionaries after a fifth-season episode of Happy Days was telecast where the character Fonzie is on waterskis as he jumps over a shark.
Marshall, born in the Bronx, also created other popular 70s shows like Mork & Mindy, and Laverne & Shirley.
Former colleagues, including Henry Winkler who starred as Fonzie in Happy Days and actor Jessica Alba who starred in Marshall's Valentines Day were amongst many who paid tribute to the director on social media.
