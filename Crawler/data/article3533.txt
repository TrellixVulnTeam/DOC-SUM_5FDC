In an unprecedented move, the administration of Uttar Pradesh’s Gautam Budh Nagar has decided to alter working hours and timings of schools, shops, factories and corporate offices in Noida, Greater Noida and other surrounding areas from January 1, to bring down vehicular pollution. The decision was taken after discussions with various stakeholders in the last one month, said G B Nagar District Magistrate N P Singh.
“We held meetings with various groups — traders, factory owners and workers, IT companies, government department officials and school authorities. Such an initiative has never been implemented in the country as a step to counter rising levels of pollution. In the last 20 days, these meetings were held daily for 3-4 hours. The scheme will be implemented from January 1,” said Singh .
He also said that a study was conducted by the environment department on the scheme. “The study showed that this move will bring down vehicular congestion by 20 per cent and, hence, lead to an overall reduction in pollution levels by 30-40 per cent,” he said. Singh added that the administration will watch the effects of the scheme for a month before altering or expanding the measure.
Under the new measure, weekly holidays have been altered for shops and commercial establishments. For instance, sectors 10, 62, 64, 87 will have a holiday on Saturday while another area comprising sectors 1, 3, 15, 16, 57,68, 80, 90, Baroli, Nithari, Morana will have their weekly holiday on Monday.
For industries in Noida, the working hours have been altered in order to reduce vehicular congestion. While factories in Sector 1 to 6 will operate from 8.30 am to 5.30 pm, sectors 7 to 11 will function from 9 am to 6 pm.
Weekly holidays in these factories have also been altered accordingly.
The administration has also altered school timings — reducing or increasing it by 15 to 20 minutes — as part of the scheme.
For instance, the new timing of Somerville Public School is from 8.15 am to 2.15 pm as opposed to the current timing — 8 am to 2 pm. Cambridge Public School, on the other hand, will function from 8.30 am to 2.30 pm against its present timing — 8 am to 2 pm.
While the local administration said the concept came up during discussions with various stakeholders on the issue of pollution, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in June had suggested variable office hours for government and private sectors in Delhi.
Urging the Centre to adopt innovative measures to tackle air pollution, the NGT had said, “Variable working hours could be a solution. Courts and government offices in Delhi open at 10 am. If we have a gap of one or two hours, this will help to reduce vehicular emission immensely.
