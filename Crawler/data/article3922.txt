The Reserve Bank of India kept its key repo lending rate unchanged at 6.75 percent on Tuesday, as widely expected, after consumer inflation picked up to a four-month high and as emerging markets brace for a hike in U.S. interest rates.
RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan left open the door for more easing, noting weak rural and global demand was holding back economic growth, while highlighting pockets of weakness in sectors such as construction.
But Rajan said further rate cuts would be dependent on inflation and external developments, while reiterating his call for banks to lower their lending rates to reflect the steep easing undertaken by the RBI this year.
