The movie made Rs 36.54 crore on Wednesday at the box office. With Eid being postponed by a day, it was a working day but had no effect on the film’s business.
Despite a 5-day weekend + reduction in ticket rates by major multiplex chains on weekdays, #Sultan maintained an IRON GRIP on Mon. AWESOME!

Day 2, which also happened to be Eid, kept the footfalls coming. With almost 90 percent occupancy in halls, the business was Rs 37.32 crore.
On Friday, the third day of the film’s release, there was a minor drop in box office collections but it was still a very respectable Rs 31.67 crore. Despite it being a working day, the positive word of mouth kept the audience coming in.
Saturday, the weekend magic began to work. There was a spike in numbers and the Salman wrestling drama earned Rs 37.1 crore.
 
Sultan had the highest earnings to report on day 5, which happened to be a Sunday. The movie earned Rs 38.21 crore, bringing the film’s total earning to Rs 180.36 crore.
The film, which has already broken way too many records, is now setting its sight high. Salman’s biggest hit till date is Bajrangi Bhaijaan whose lifetime earnings are Rs 316 crore.
Sultan is the biggest opener of 2016, the film has done the highest business of all Salman Khan films and it has broken all records of this year. With its four-day collections, it is already the biggest grosser of the year having eclipsed the lifetime collections of Airlift (Rs 127.8 crore) and Housefull 3 (Rs 107.7 crore).
The huge collection means that the film had already surpassed Prem Ratan Dhan Payo (Rs 129.7 crore) and Happy New Year’s (Rs 108.8 crore) record on the fourth day to become the highest opening weekend grosser, before Sunday even arrived.
