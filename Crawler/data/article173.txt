New Delhi, Aug 7 (PTI) CCTV cameras will be installed and civil defence volunteers deployed in the offices of AAP MLAs after the Delhi Assembly Speaker today conceded the demand of the legislators who had expressed apprehension that they might be "framed" in false cases.
The decision came a day after the lawmakers of the ruling Aam Aadmi Party met Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel in this regard.
Goel said the three BJP MLAs will also get the facilities if they make a request in this regard.
The 70-member Delhi Assembly has 67 AAP MLAs and three BJP legislators.
"Public Works Department (PWD) has been asked to install CCTV cameras at the offices of the MLAs. As per requirement, civil defence volunteers will also be deployed at their offices to manage people visiting all theï¿½MLAs' offices," Assembly said.
As the Assembly Speaker is the "head" of all MLAs, it is "his constitutional" duty to take such decision for the welfare of the elected legislators, he said.
"If all three BJP MLAs also want to get the same facility, Assembly will definitely install CCTV cameras and deploy civil defence volunteers at their offices," Goel said.
"We have seen in recent past that several allegations have been levelled against some of AAP MLAs. Groups of people suddenly come to MLAs offices and level allegations against them.
"Police also swiftly takes action on these complaints and MLAs then don't have strong evidence to defend themselves. CCTV cameras and deployment of Civil Defence at the legislators' offices will ensure vigil," the Assembly Speaker said.
He also said civil defence volunteers will only be deployed at MLAs offices in their constituencies, adding that dismissing suggestion that the Delhi Assembly was providing security to the MLAs.
Since the Aam Aadmi Party government has been formed in Delhi in February last year, 12 AAP have been arrested so far on various allegations.
