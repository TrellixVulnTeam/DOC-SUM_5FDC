Speaking at a ”Woman in Motion” talk on Sunday, Sarandon said of Allen: ”I think he sexually assaulted a child and I don’t think that’s right.” Sarandon, who was speaking alongside Geena Davis, declined to comment further on the subject.


Allen’s ”Cafe Society” opened the festival on Wednesday. A column posted the same day by his son, Ronan Farrow, called for media, moviegoers and film festivals to reconsider their embrace of the director.
