At the AAP’s Women’s Dialogue at Khanna on Sunday, women voters came out to demand that party the should look at their cause with empathy.
“We came to take feedback from women for our election manifesto, but we saw them breaking down in front of us. They suffer the most due to all the problems of the state,” said Baljinder Kaur, president, AAP Women’s Wing.
Women from Khanna also expressed that they were just as capable as the men, but that they were not allowed to explore their potential and were often snubbed to stay indoors.
“Their capability is under estimated by men and they are not being allowed to come to the fore front and we can see live example in politics where men folk are seen in front in all political parties,” said Kaur.
Over 800 women came in women’s dialogue. “Our manifesto will look into women centric issues and give them more opportunity to study and to work in mainstream,” said Kaur.
