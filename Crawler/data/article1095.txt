A first-ever association for Indian Olympians, by the Olympians, called The Olympians Association of India (OAI) was launched on Monday.
OAI will be the official voice of the Indian Olympian community this year, and its Twitter account, @IndianOlympians, will serve as the one-stop platform for real-time updates.
Aneesh Madani, the Head of Sports Partnerships at Twitter India said, “It was treat for the fans to witness the launch of the Olympian Association of India through Tweets from Indian Champions. Twitter is the best place for fans to see what’s happening in the lead up to the Olympics and with the launch of the Olympians Association of India, fans will be able to connect to their favourite #OnlyOnTwitter.
Five-time Olympian Shiva Keshavan said, “One of our key programs for the Olympians Association of India is outreach and we will be using @IndianOlympians on Twitter as the first and most authentic source to share news about our athletes and for fans to connect with them directly.”
