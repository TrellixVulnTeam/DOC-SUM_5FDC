Refusing to share the euphoria of BJP over the assembly poll results, Shiv Sena today said “Modi magic” did not work in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu though the saffron party could capture power in Assam.
“We have to unfortunately say that the Modi magic did not work and the BJP could not win in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu by dethroning regional parties easily,” Sena’s mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ said in an editorial.
“The BJP ousted the Congress to register a win in Assam. But, it could not dethrone Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal, Jayalalithaa in Tamil Nadu and the Left in Kerala. This means that the BJP could not defeat regional parties in their bastions,” Sena said.
“People are saying that the Congress has been vaporised in air. But, if we keep Assam aside, what has happened to the BJP?” the Sena asked.
“In Kerala, the Congress and the Left keep winning by turns. This time the Left has won. Here, the BJP has to take
solace in their ‘Acche din’ as it only managed to open its account,” it said.
