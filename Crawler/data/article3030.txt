In the midst of women demanding access to Shani Shingnapur temple and other sacred places in Maharashtra, Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi Friday said the matter should be left to the society to decide.
“The society will itself level it out. There should not be any political comment on it,” Gandhi said.
Women’s outfits have been spearheading campaign against centuries-old ban on female devotees entering the sanctum sanctorum of Shani Shingnapur temple in Maharashtra.
Over 400 women had launched a protest against the tradition of not allowing women at the inner platform (chauthara) of the temple where only men are permitted to make offerings to the deity (Shani).
They have submitted a memorandum to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis seeking his support to end gender bias and allow women’s entry at the temple and all other sacred places in the state.
