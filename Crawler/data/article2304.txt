Reiterating an existing provision in the rules, the government has said that “strict action” will be taken against IAS and IPS officers found overstaying while on foreign assignments.
In a letter to Union government secretaries and chief secretaries of states, Cabinet Secretary P K Sinha has stated that several instances have come to notice in which officers were found staying on foreign assignments beyond their approved tenure. “This trend needs to be discouraged by ensuring strict action against errant officers as per extant policy,” Sinha wrote.
An officer of the three all-India services — the Indian Administrative Service, Indian Police Service and Indian Forest Service — among others, can stay a maximum of five years on foreign deputation.

A plan to increase the deputation period to seven years is under consideration.
Sinha wrote that state governments should also forward a proposal to the cadre-controlling authority concerned — Department of Personnel and Training for IAS officers, Home Ministry for IPS, and Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for India Forest Service— for taking further action on the issue.
“Cadre controlling authorities are once again impressed upon to ensure that extant provisions in this matter are strictly followed and that the officers are made aware of the implications of overstay before they are relieved for taking up their foreign assignments,” he wrote.
“Cadre controlling authorities are further advised to make sure that officers do not continue on foreign assignment beyond the approved tenure and that they report back to their cadre immediately after completion of approved tenure.”
