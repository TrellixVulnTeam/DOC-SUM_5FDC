Railways on Friday launched Rail Geet, a 3-minute song with moving trains visuals, to enthuse railwaymen and establish a connect with general public at large.
Composed by noted music director Shravan and sung by acclaimed singers Udit Narayan and Kavita Krishnamurti, the song “Indian Railways, we love Indian Railways” will be played now at the beginning of every railway function.
“Symbols in our country play a very important role in motivating and inspiring people and this “Rail Geet” will be such a symbol for all railwaymen and rail users. It will give them the spirit of marching ahead and working unitedly for the growth of Indian Railways,” said Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu after launching the Rail Geet.
Thanking all those involved in preparing the song, Prabhu pointed out that even during freedom struggles many songs and slogans worked as vehicles of inspiration for millions of people.
Referring to the hard work being done by the railwaymen in running the huge railway network successfully, Prabhu said that this song will reflect the commitment and dedication of lakhs of railway employees. Earlier, the Railways made a TV commercial “Rail gaadi chhuk chhuk” showing a human train running during the Commonwealth Games in 2010.
