Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah has questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “silence” on the situation in the Valley which he termed as “heart breaking” and “worrying”.
“Heart breaking & worrying in equal measure. At what point will the Centre (read Hon PM) wake up to the crisis here?” Omar wrote on twitter late last night. He was reacting to the death of three persons in security forces action after violent protests yesterday. The opposition National Conference working president had hit out at the Centre for claiming that the situation in the Valley was improving. “1 (one) more unfortunate death, countless injuries today & the Centre tells the Hon SC (Supreme Court) that ‘things are improving’. Wow!” Omar wrote.

In another tweet, Omar said it was only the ruling coalition partners — PDP and BJP — who agreed with this stand.
“Seriously? By which stretch of imagination? I haven’t met anyone in the Valley except the BJP-PDP ostriches who agree!” he said.
The Centre on Friday told the Supreme Court that the law and order situation in Kashmir Valley has improved considerably since the outrebrak of violence following the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani on July 8. It said the violent protests having gone down from 201 on July 9 to 11 on August 3. With yesterday’s three deaths, the toll in the violence in the Valley has now reached 54.
