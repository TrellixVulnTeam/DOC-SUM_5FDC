Ousted Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat on Sunday alleged that central agencies were being misused to “harass” MLAs and leaders, who were being threatened and their phones were getting tapped ahead of the trust vote in the state Assembly on Tuesday.
“Our MLAs and leaders are getting threatening messages from conduits who are posing as relatives, well-wishers and acquaintances,” Rawat told reporters here.
“I am also being kept under surveillance as if I am an anti-national,” he alleged.
Rawat alleged that his phones and those of his relatives and aides were being tapped. “Central agencies are harassing Congress people through various ways,” he alleged.
“Central agencies are openly being misused and not only my MLAs but political leaders are being threatened,” he said.
His allegations came on a day another video of a purported sting operation was released allegedly involving Rawat and he was accused of indulging in horse-trading.
Asked about the video, Rawat said that he had no information about it as of now.
The Congress leader voiced confidence that he will win the trust vote which will be held on May 10 following the direction of the Supreme Court.
The apex court was hearing the Centre’s petition challenging the revoking of President’s rule by the Uttarakhand High Court on Rawat’s plea.
