For a few days now, there have been rumours of Karisma Kapoor's ex-husband Sunjay Kapur creating a scene at a London restaurant on seeing her with her beau Sandeep Toshniwal.

However, on Friday (July 8), Sunjay refuted the news doing the rounds.
"In the light of some patently mischievous news in the media, I am issuing this statement to state that all reports in the press about us are incorrect. While we have agreed to part as partners in marriage, we both are deeply committed to our children whose happiness is foremost in our hearts. We both will always be cordial to each other and wish the best for one another. I thank our friends and media for their support and request that all speculation be put to rest finally," read the recently-released statement.
For the uninitiated, a report in Mumbai Mirror a few days ago read how Sunjay lost his cool on seeing Karisma and Sandeep in the same restaurant in London that he was dining in.
Sunjay apparently threw a fit on seeing his former wife with her good friend and he began shouting and made a scene.
Karisma Kapoor and Sunjay Kapur were granted divorce only a couple of weeks ago, after one of the ugliest legal battles in Bollywood in recent time. Karisma and Sunjay have two children together, son Kiaan and daughter Samiera.
