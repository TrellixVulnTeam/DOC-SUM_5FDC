Dehradun, Jun 16 (PTI) Rattled by office of profit charges against the Kejriwal government in Delhi, Aam Admi Party today demanded disqualification of 20 MLAs in Uttarakhand accusing them of occupying offices of profit.
In a letter to President Pranab Mukherjee, AAP's Uttarakhand President Anoop Nautiyal said 20 MLAs were recently made Parliamentary Secretaries in violation of the Office of Profit rule.
While nine MLAs were appointed as Parliamentary Secretaries with Cabinet ranks by Harish Rawat government on June 11,�eleven legislators were appointed as heads of different boards on May 3, he said .
They were all provided vehicles fitted with red beacon lights as part of their appointment, Nautiyal said.
Alleging that their appointment was in violation of the Office of Profit law, the AAP leader urged the President to look into his petition saying such appointments had further hurt the state's image after rampant political corruption had created a legislative crisis in the state recently.
"As you are aware, Uttarakhand has recently been in the midst of a major legislative crisis due to rampant political corruption. Illegal and brazen appointments, as mentioned above, with scant regard for the law of the land have further dented the image and limited resources of our state.
"I earnestly hope that your office shall act with alacrity and fair play in looking into the petition regarding violation of Office of Profit in the Uttarakhand legislative assembly," Nautiyal said.
Nine �MLAs who were made Parliamentary Secretaries by Rawat are Vijayapal Sajwan, Ganesh Godiyal, Hemesh Kharkwal, Manoj Tiwari, Jeet Ram, Madan Singh Bisht, Rajkumar, Vikram Singh Negi, Sarita Arya.
