Taylor Swift is giving some financial assistance to fellow pop star Kesha as she battles to get out of a contract with Dr. Luke, whom she has accused of sexually assaulting her.
A representative for Swift confirmed on Sunday night that Swift had donated $250,000 to Kesha in what she called a “show of support” to help her in her legal battle with Dr. Luke, the megahit producer. On Friday, Kesha sobbed in court as a judge denied her bid to get out of her contract with Dr. Luke, who has worked with artists ranging from Britney Spears to Katy Perry to Nicki Minaj. Dr. Luke has denied Kesha’s allegations, accusing the “Tik Tok” singer of fabricating the charges to get out of the contract. (Read: Kesha sobs as judge retains contract with record producer
While the court decision is not the final judgment in the case, the decision has led to an outpouring of support for Kesha on social media from other celebrities, including Kelly Clarkson, who once worked with Dr. Luke.
A rep for Kesha did not immediately return a message seeking comment on Swift’s donation.
