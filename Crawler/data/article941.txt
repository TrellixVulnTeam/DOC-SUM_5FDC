Farmers from more than a dozen states put fruits, vegetables, flowers and processed items on display and for sale at the event.
The process of taking over Rajendra Agriculture University in Bihar, which got Central University status recently, will be completed within a month or two, Singh said.
A bill to upgrade the university to a Central university was passed in the last session of Parliament.
Stressing that the state’s atmosphere and land are fit for horticulture development, Paswan said, a food processing industry would be set up in Hajipur or its adjoining area, provided the state government cooperates on this.
