Debut filmmaker Kaustav Narayan Niyogi, who has directed the bold film “Cabaret”, says he hopes to get a U/A certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) for his film.
Niyogi told IANS: “I am not worried about censor board at all because when I say bold, it’s nothing to do with vulgar or over the top shots. I have shot it all aesthetically. I am hoping ‘Cabaret’ will get U/A certificate. In fact, the idea of the film is bold and courageous. For me, ‘Cabaret’ is a musical romantic thriller.”
Produced by Pooja Bhatt, “Cabaret” features Richa Chadha, Gulshan Devaiah and cricketer S. Sreesanth.
“Sreesanth plays the role of godfather. He is like a brother figure to the female character in the film. He has a very interesting role in the film,” Niyogi said.
