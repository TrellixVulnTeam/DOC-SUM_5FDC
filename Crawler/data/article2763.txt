Riteish Deshmukh has been spotted with hair grown till shoulders these days, which is because of his role in the upcoming film ‘Banjo’. The movie, which portrays him as a band member demanded long hair out of the actor. The first look of Riteish has been revealed and the actor looks no less than a trained drummer.
A never seen before look of Riteish is interesting as this is the first time that he will play a band member.
“The film is a journey, rather than a story. It is a journey in which someone crosses seven seas to meet her dreams. And some reach their hearts to meet themselves. Orchestrated by destiny, a DJ from US meets a Banjo party from Mumbai. They take the leap, they fly, they rise, they stumble, they dust, and they stand again,” said a source.
Riteish will be seen romancing Nargis Fakhri in the film for the very first time in his career.
Banjo has been directed by Ravi Jadhav and produced by Krishika Lulla.
