Varanasi, Jul 3 (PTI) The head of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's adopted village Jayapur was arrested along with his son and nephew for allegedly beating up an RTI activist for complaining about alleged misuse of funds.
Village head Narendra Patel, his son Rahul and nephew Mukesh were arrested on Friday for beating up RTI activist Ashok Singh and others and produced before a magistrate who remanded them in judicial custody, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Akash Kulhary said.
Singh had complained that on May 27, the trio thrashed him and few others after a district administration team visited the village that day to probe a complaint of misuse of funds made by him, Circle Officer (Sadar) Ram Sevak Yadav said.
On the basis of Singh's complaint, an FIR was registered under relevant sections of IPC including 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), he said.
The family members of Patel, however, have termed the incident as a�case of political vendetta and alleged that people from the�ruling Samajwadi Party were behind the trio's arrest.
Local BJP leaders also came in support of the village head.
BJP Kashi region president Laxman Acharya said the party had objected to the arrest of the village head, his son and nephew and demanded the police conduct a fair and unbiased probe.
