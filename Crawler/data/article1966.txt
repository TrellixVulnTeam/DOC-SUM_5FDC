Actor John Boyega says “Star Wars: Episode VIII” director Rian Johnson will be taking the film in a different and darker direction.
The 24-year-old actor, who plays Finn in the Star Wars universe, said viewers should expect something different to “The Force Awakens,” reported Variety.
“Rian Johnson is great. It’s a different take, darker, bigger. Someone will say: ‘How do you get bigger than ‘Force Awakens?’ But it’s crazy,” Boyega said.
He also revealed about the equation his and Daisy Ridley’s character, Rey, will share in the next movie.


“I mean, we didn’t establish a romance in seven; we never played it that way. Daisy and I, we’re friends.
“Finn and Rey – they’re just friends. Finn is a stormtrooper, so he doesn’t really know what’s going on. So the romance thing is something that’s going to be interesting in the next instalment. It’s not going to go the way you think it’s going to go,” he said.
“Episode VIII”, would see cast members Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher reprising their roles
“Star Wars: Episode VIII” will release on December 15, 2017.
