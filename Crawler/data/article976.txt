Shah Rukh Khan is somewhat in the shadows these days, with Salman Khan's Sultan kicking up a storm at the box office and Aamir Khan owning social media with the promotions of his latest release, Dangal. However, the Ra.One actor took time out to interact with the media for Eid celebrations outside his residence, Mannat.

The actor was candid as always when asked about the much-anticipated clash between Salman's Sultan and Shah Rukh's Raees (which was supposed to have an Eid release, but got postponed). Shah Rukh said, "Budget of the film suffers if the movie is not releasing on 4,000 screens. One needs to have 8,000 to 10,000 theatres for two movies to release at the same time. I don't think two big films can release at the same time. Secondly, I suffered some injuries and there are body shot portions I still need to shoot."

The Happy New Year actor also cited sticking to his image of a romantic hero, rather than giving in to the fad of wrestler movies. He said, "Let Aamir and Salman handle wrestling. Two of them are enough to handle wrestling. Above all I don't look like a wrestler from any angle. I am a romantic hero and I don't know wrestling."
Raees will now release on Jan 26, 2017, where it is expected to clash with Hrithik Roshan's Kaabil. Kaabil is being directed by Sanjay Gupta, while Parzania-director Rahul Dholakia is directing Raees which will also see Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Mahira Khan in significant roles.
