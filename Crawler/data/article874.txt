Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat will on Monday inaugurate the ‘Shaktiman Park’ named after police horse ‘Shaktiman’, who was critically maimed in a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rally carried out by MP Ganesh Joshi earlier on March 14.
The ‘Shaktiman Park’ has been constructed in Dehradun Police Line. Shaktiman was a well-trained 13-year-old horse of the Uttarakhand Mounted Police for many years.

When the horse was deployed by the police during a BJP rally, MP Ganesh Joshi had allegedly attacked the horse’s leg with a lathi, critically injuring it for the remainder of its days.
The outrage over this incidence of gross animal abuse grew so large that MP Ganesh Joshi was briefly arrested.
Almost a month after losing his left hind leg in the attack, the white-coloured Kathiawari horse succumbed to its injuries on April 20.
