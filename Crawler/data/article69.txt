A BJP member in Lok Sabha on Friday, attacked the Centre over its handling of the Kashmir issue, saying its strategy was “totally wrong” and demanded that the terrorists and separatists be dealt with sternly.
R K Singh, a former home secretary, said a Jammu and Kashmir government minister was recently targetted in a bomb attack and some police stations and outposts were vacated by cops during the recent unrest.
“The current Kashmir strategy of the government is totally wrong… Its handling of separatists and some terrorists is not correct. It is wrong,” he said during Zero Hour.
He said the majority of people in Kashmir wanted peace and harmony and were against violence. A handful of terrorists have scared the majority there, Singh said.
Separatists should also be prosecuted and measures taken to stop the flow of hawala money, he said, adding that border should be fenced to stop infiltration.
