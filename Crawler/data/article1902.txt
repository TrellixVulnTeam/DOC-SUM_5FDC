Thanking the people for the “unprecedented victory”, Banerjee said politics in the state had hit a “historic low” during the electioneering and there should be a “Laxman Rekha” to maintain decency in public discourse.
“It is an unprecedented victory despite a joint opposition unleashing violence. I thank people of Bengal from bottom of my heart for keeping faith in Trinamool Congress. The opposition had spun a web of lies which has been rejected,” Banerjee said addressing a press conference.
