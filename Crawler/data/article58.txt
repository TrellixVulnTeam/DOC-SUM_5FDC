A station in charge and two other police officials were on Friday suspended, a day after a 26-year-old dalit man was found dead under suspicious circumstances at Ahirwan police station lockup.
Kamal Valmiki, a resident of Shiv Katra village, was found dead at Ahirwan police station on Thursday afternoon after he was picked up along with another man, Raju Mistri, in a case of loot.
While twelve police personnel were suspended on Thursday, three officials were suspended on Friday for allegedly beating Kamal to death. Meanwhile, Raju Mistry was held on Friday by the police from his relative’s home.
The family members of the deceased had earlier filed an FIR against the station in charge and other police personnel for allegedly beating Kamal to death. Another FIR was lodged against unidentified people after Mistry was reported missing on Thursday.
District administration has directed the magistrate to investigate the matter and pay compensation to the victim’s family.
“Three officers, including station in charge Jiwanram Yadav has been suspended in this connection and now the number of suspended police personnel have climbed to 15,” SP, Mathura, Shalabh Mathur said.
Police contingent have been deployed in the area due to tense situation in the wake of protests by the members of Valmiki community, who blocked the Kanpur-Lucknow highway and threw stones at the police station on Thursday.
