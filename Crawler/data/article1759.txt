Haryana Congress leader Ajay Yadav Sunday sought inquiry into the violence during the February Jat reservation stir from a sitting judge of the Supreme Court. He has also demanded that the BJP government in Haryana should explain on what basis was reservation given to the Jats.
Addressing a press conference, Yadav said that the government should bring a white paper on caste wise division of allocation of jobs. Yadav said that the saffron party has replicated the Gujarat model in Haryana and tried to create divisions on basis of Jat and non-Jat communities. “The MLAs and MPs of BJP have said that members of their own party were involved. The BJP is doing this to divert attention of the people as it has not fulfilled any of its election promises,” he said.
Commenting on the Prakash Singh Committee Report, the Haryana Congress leader said that the report cannot be considered as fair as he himself admitted that he was being pressurised while making the report. “There is a need to have a judicial inquiry by a sitting Supreme Court judge, he said. He also criticised the clean chit given to the intelligence agencies.
Yadav said that under the aegis of Haryana Bachao Sangharsh Samiti a memorandum will be submitted to the Prime Minister on May 29 and the issues will be raised with the Haryana Governor Kaptan Singh Solanki as well.
