Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Monday launched the ‘e-District’ project through which residents will be able to access a host of government services online and get documents verified for the issuance of certificates.
The launch comes days after the Cabinet approved a proposal to make 12 government services hassle-free by doing away with the need to produce affidavits, and introducing the concept of self-attestation.
In the first phase, the certificates chosen include OBC, SC/ST, domicile, disability card, income, solvency, death certificate, marriage registration, birth certificate and lal dora certificate.
These 12 services excluding revenue courts are online.
As part of the project, chief secretary K K Sharma said the government has completely digitised caste documents as early as 1967 till the present date.
Officials said to get a caste certificate, the documents required are identification proof, residence proof, caste certificate of any paternal relative, proof
of relation and a self-declaration certificate.
