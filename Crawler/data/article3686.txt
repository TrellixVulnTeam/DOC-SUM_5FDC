Hitting back at the Aam Aadmi Party leaders over allegations of financial irregularities in DDCA during his tenures, Arun Jaitley on Thursday said that Arvind Kejriwal, seems to believe in untruth and defamation, delivered in a language that borders on hysteria.
In his latest blog, Jaitley slammed AAP leaders for making allegations of corruption in DDCA after the CBI raid at Delhi Principal Secretary Rajendra Kumar’s office, saying ‘does free speech include the right to speak only falsehood.’
“Free speech is unquestionably a pre-eminent Fundamental Right, but does free speech include the right to speak only falsehood? The Delhi Chief Minister, Mr. Arvind Kejriwal, seems to believe in untruth and defamation, delivered in a language that borders on hysteria,” writes Jaitley in his blog.
Earlier in the day, the Aam Aadmi Party, which rules Delhi, accused Jaitley of indulging in financial irregularities while he was at the helm of the Delhi Cricket Board (DDCA). The party also exhorted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to sack Jaitley from the union cabinet.
