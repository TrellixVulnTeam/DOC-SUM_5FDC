The Supreme Court today asked Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to explore the possibility of providing premium service where passengers can book seats in metros by paying five-six times more than the normal fare.
A bench headed by Chief Justice T S Thakur directed Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar to take instruction from the DMRC on augmenting the rolling stock and increasing the frequency of service in view of the ongoing implementation of odd-even formula in the national capital.
The apex court made mention of people owning luxury cars like Mercedes Benz who have to leave their luxury vehicles at home in the wake of the odd-even formula.
“Metro authority can think of having special coaches and seats for such type of people so that they have ‘dignified’ place to sit and can pay higher money. They must have some space if they leave their cars at home,” the bench, also comprising justices A K Sikri and R Banumathi, said.
Senior advocate Harish Salve, who is the amicus curiae in a 1985 PIL filed by environmentalist M C Mehta, suggested that air-conditioned buses could be plied for them.
