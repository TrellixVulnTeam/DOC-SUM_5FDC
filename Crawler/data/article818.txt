The Walt Disney Company has released a first image of the Star Wars-themed land that will be built at Disneyland in California and at the Walt Disney World resorts.
The 14-acre attraction is largest single-themed expansion in the theme park’s 60-year history, and work on its construction began in April. An opening date is yet to be announced.
The press release posted to Disney Parks Blog says:
Nestled between towering spires of rock, this thriving port contains a seemingly familiar architecture of markets, landing zones and buildings. Look closely and you may find hints of some of the thrilling experiences that are coming – like the Millennium Falcon peeking out of one of the cargo bays, marking the location where guests will get the opportunity to pilot the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.
Speaking last August, Disney CEO Bob Iger promised: “These new lands at Disneyland and Walt Disney World will transport guests to a whole new Star Wars planet.”
