New Delhi/Chandigarh, July 20 (ANI): Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president Capt. Amarinder Singh has said former Amritsar MP Navjot Singh Sidhu was welcome to the Congress if he desired so.
"Congress' doors are open for everyone," he said.
However, Capt Amarinder clarified that there was no communication between him and Sidhu on the matter. Asked whether any Congress leader was in touch with Sidhu, he said on Tuesday that "not to his knowledge".
Interacting with reporters here, the PCC president said Sidhu had a Congress background as his father late Bhagwant Singh Sidhu was associated with the Patiala District Congress Committee.
"When my mother was Patiala DCC president, Sidhu's father was her general secretary," he said referring a long association of the Sidhu family with the Congress.
He said later he served as the Punjab Advocate General during the regime of Darbara Singh.
Asked whether he had met Sidhu of late, Capt Amarinder said, "We are both from Patiala and we are both Sidhus". He said he had seen him playing and practicing cricket when he was young. "I don't remember having met him for a long time now," he added.
Replying to another question whether the Congress party will initiate any move to invite him to join the Congress, the PCC president pointed out, "he is yet to resign from the BJP". (ANI)
