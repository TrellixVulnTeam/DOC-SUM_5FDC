Irrfan met Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi on Tuesday (July 19) as a common man of the country and put to him several questions on changes in the nation's political system and about freedom of expression.
EXCLUSIVE: 'Usne yeh bol dia' cannot be an issue worthy of debate on every channel, says Irrfan
Irrfan, who earlier met and interviewed Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav during his visit to Bihar capital Patna recently, had a candid chat with Aam Aadmi Party convenor Kejriwal as a part of promotional activity for his upcoming film Madaari.
During his 30-minute interaction with Kejriwal, Irrfan asked various questions like how to be part of the system, about freedom of expression, and changes in the politics arena.
Often called India's most popular export to Hollywood, Irrfan reached out to Kejriwal to fix a meeting via Twitter. He also tweeted to Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
While Kejriwal immediately responded, fixing a meeting with Irrfan at his office at 11am today, Gandhi asked Irrfan to message him his contact number and the Prime Minister's Office asked him to send a letter with the details.
Madaari, which explores a father-son relationship and traces the plight of a common man who loses his son in an accident, also features Jimmy Sheirgill in a pivotal role. The film is slated to release on July 22.
