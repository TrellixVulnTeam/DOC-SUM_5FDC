Rubbishing reports of Chinese incursion in Uttarakhand, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Thursday said it was just a transgression which was settled, adding that there was a well-defined mechanism to settle such transgressions.
“India-China border is not formally demarcated. There are areas where both sides have differing perceptions of LAC. Barhoti (Uttarakhand) is one such area. There was no incursion, just transgression which has been settled. There is a well defined mechanism to settle such transgressions,” Parrikar said in Lok Sabha.
The Centre has downplayed the Chinese incursion, saying that it was not a very serious issue and they will resolve it on ground level.
“The briefing that we have received from DG of the Indo Tibetan Border Police Force (ITBP) according to that some incident of incursion has been witnessed there. But that is not a very serious issue,” said Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju.
Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat yesterday confirmed an incursion by the Chinese troops into Chamoli district.
Rawat, however, made a somersault later in the day and said there is an increase in the number of Chinese troops along the Indian border, but ruled out any incursion into Indian territory.
Uttarakhand shares a 350 kilometer long boundary with China and similar attempts at Chinese incursions have been reported in the past.
The last reported Chinese incursion in the state was when the word ‘China’ was inscribed on rocks near Mana Pass in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand.
