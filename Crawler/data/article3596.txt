London: Star Wars spoilers for ticketless rides ||||
 Tubes run by London Transport are using spoiler alerts for the movie, Star Wars: The Force Awakens', as threats along with penalty to prevent commuters from travelling without a ticket. People across various districts of London reported of sighting similar messages at a few stations of London Transport. Another station was spotted with a Star Wars-themed 'thought of the day'. ||||

Star Wars fans who haven’t managed to see the new movie yet would obviously stay away from spoilers, but it seems that London’s commuters need to be extra careful. In a unique way to make sure people don’t travel without tickets, Transport for London (TfL) has jokingly put out spoiler-alert messages warning commuters to buy tickets otherwise they’ll reveal the ending of the new Star Wars movie, ‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’.
Only a day after the film was released, people spotted similar messages at a few stations in various districts of London.
“Attention. Anyone travelling without a valid ticket or Oyster will be told the ending to the new Star Wars film (and also get a penalty fare),” says the message.

The mania didn’t end here, another Star Wars-themed ‘Thought of the day’ was seen at Earl’s Court station. It said “Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering”- Yoda.
