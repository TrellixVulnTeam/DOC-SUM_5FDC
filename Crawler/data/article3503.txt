Celebs post identical tweets for Reliance Jio ||||
 Many Bollywood celebrities were spotted posting the same congratulatory text about Reliance Jio on Twitter on Sunday when the 4G telecom service was launched. Some of these celebrities were Sonakshi Sinha, Hrithik Roshan, and Kapil Sharma. However, some celebrities like Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan tweaked their tweets. Twitter users asked if these celebrities were being paid for publicity. ||||

On December 27, Reliance Jio Infocomm and brand ambassador actor Shah Rukh Khan launched Jio‚Äôs 4G telecom service for its employees at a star-studded event in Mumbai. Khan and many celebrities took to micro-blogging site Twitter to congratulate the telecom arm of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries.
So far, it all sounds very normal, but what is interesting is the content of these congratulatory messages. If one scrolled through the tweets, it would seem as if all these stars had the exact same thoughts, word-for-word, as they tweeted out their messages. They all used the hashtag #CelebratingJio, which soon became a top trend on Twitter.
Congratulations to the Jio family on this landmark day! This truly seems like the beginning of a Digital India #CelebratingJio

Though, some decided to tweak the message a little. Perhaps, after realising that most from the fraternity are putting out the same text.

These clone tweets caught the attention of many on social media, with some suspecting that it may have been a paid campaign. Copy-Paste, you think?
The insane level of celebrity endorsement is simply a reminder that the opposite of #Jio is Maro

Airtel only had the 4G girl but now every Tom, Dick, Harry and Twitter celeb is hyping about Jio. I‚Äôm afraid to be seen with my phone now.

Maybe Reliance Jio is so amazing that every celeb had the same reaction to it. Or they are just trolling Mukeshbhai pic.twitter.com/Foy1ZU0e5h

I don‚Äôt blame Reliance employees (including TV18 folks) for their Jio tweets; but the celeb copy-pasters are pretty shameless

Every #Bollywood celeb is tweeting the same bloody text for #jio launch. Whats the story here??

Are people getting paid to tweet about jio? Every celeb and even media Persian tweeting.
