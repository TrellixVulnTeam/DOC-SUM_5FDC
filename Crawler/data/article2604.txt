Taapsee Pannu and Ali Fazal have been paired together in actor Prakash Raj’s directorial debut ‘Tadka’, which is a remake of the Tamil film Un Samayal Arayil. The plot revolves around two strangers who get connected over a wrong phone call.
Nana Patekar and Shriya Saran will also star in the film.
“It’s so exciting that finally Prakash Sir will direct me. I have acted with him in two movies in Telugu before and we had such a great time working with each other. His energy is infectious. Icing on the cake being I will get to share screen space with THE Nana Patekar. I have seen the film in South but a lot has changed in it now to suit the sensibilities of Hindi audience and I’m nothing short of thrilled to be doing this role in such an amazing star cast,” said Taapsee.


“I have always admired Prakash sir’s work, be it down south or here. Being directed by him is going to be an adventure I look forward to. Its one of the most endearing stories I have had the chance to work on. Look forward to bringing some tadka to the canvas. Also blessed with a lovely co-star, Taapsee, and Nana Patekar and Shriya Saran. The ball is rolling and we’re all set to jump in,” said Ali.
The film will begin shooting in Goa from May.
