“To mark the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare’s death, women from the Outdoor Co-ed Topless Pulp Fiction Appreciation Society decided to go for something unique when staging his final play — doing so when naked is certainly something unique,” the RT online reported.
The group members stated that they chose The Tempest because of its “central themes of alienation and reconciliation” and used nudity to show the difference between the shipwreck victims “initially forced to navigate the play’s island setting in constricting outfits suggestive of European aristocracy”, in contrast to the openness and “naked innocence” of Miranda and her father.
“We want the audience to see it through fresh eyes as something rich and strange, the way an audience 400 years ago would have,” said Director Alice Mottola.
