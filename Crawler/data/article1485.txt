Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said the government stands by Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian suggesting that there was no question of him being removed.
Speaking at a press conference post the Cabinet meeting, Jatiley said Arvind Subramanian’s contributions to decision making were valuable to the government.
“The government has full confidence in CEA Arvind Subramanian. He has provided valuable insights from time to time. We do not share Subramanian Swamy’s view,” Jaitley said.

When asked about RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan’s exit, Jaitley denied suggestions that the government and the BJP did not defend Rajan in the face of Swamy’s attacks.
“To what extent should we take this?… Politicians should see to what extent we should attack those whose discipline and constraints of their offices prevent them from responding,” he added.
Party president (Amit Shah) had specifically stated that the BJP doesn’t agree with that comment, Jaitley said, referring to Swamy’s remarks against Rajan.
Watch: Sack Arvind Subramanian, says Subramanian Swamy
Earlier in the day, Swamy had demanded that the government sack Arvind Subramanian saying was not working in tandem with the Narendra Modi government.
“Such people who can fail our government, such people should be tossed out. Now, it has been two years. He (Arvind) used to work in America, don’t even know if he’s a citizen or not but I’m sure he has a green card (sic),” Swamy said.
The BJP, too, distanced itself from Rajya Sabha MP Swamy’s remarks against Arvind Subramanian.
“BJP does not agree with Subramanian Swamy’s views on the government’s Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian. This is his personal opinion,” the party said in a statement.
