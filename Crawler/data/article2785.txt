Actress Kareena Kapoor seems to have broken the no-kissing policy on screen that she had committed to her actor husband Saif Ali Khan after tying the knot in 2012. Arjun Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor, who set the fire on screen striking a smoking hot romantic pose at the start of the year, are now seen sharing a sweet kiss in Ki and Kaâ€™s new poster.
The chemistry between the duo looks amazing since Arjun and Kareena have been paired opposite each other for the first time onscreen.
Arjun Kapoor plays the character of Kabir, an IIT graduate and a house husband, who has grown up wanting to be like his mother and not like his father and will be seen doing household.
On the other hand, Kareena Kapoor plays the character of Kia, an ambitious and a career-oriented woman in the film.
The film, which follows the relationship of the married couples, also features megastar Amitabh Bachchan and wife Jaya in special appearance.
Directed by R Balki, the film is slated to release on April 1.
