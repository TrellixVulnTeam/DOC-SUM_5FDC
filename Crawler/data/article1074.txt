While it's been years since these ladies cast a spell in a bikini, actresses Raquel Welch, Ursula Andress and Marilyn Monroe continue to be hot favourites.
In a poll of 2,000 women conducted by Swimwear365 in order to mark Britain's National Bikini Day on July 5, actress Raquel Welch managed to clinch the top spot of the 50 hottest ever bikini babes, even though it's been 50 years since she scorched the screen in a fur bikini, while playing a cave woman in the film One Million Years BC.

Among the 50 names featured are Pamela Anderson, Brigitte Bardot, Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce, Rihanna, Helen Mirren, Twiggy, Katy Perry and Katie Price, among others.
From the Kardashian-Jenner sisters, only Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner made it to the list. While her leaked bikini pictures from her vacations have been frowned upon in the past, the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, managed to make it to the 24th position on the list.
