The Bharatiya Janata Party has expelled 12 party leaders and served showcause notices to two others for
allegedly attacking its MP Keshav Prasad Maurya when he visited the district party office last week in Ballia, Uttar Pradesh.
“Show cause notices have been served to former MLA Ram Iqbal Singh and Babban Singh Raghuvanshi while 12 leaders have been expelled from the party by state president Laxmikant Bajpai,” a senior party leader said here.
The action was taken for anti-party activities after the leaders allegedly attacked party MP Maurya on January 4 when he was in Ballia for organisational elections, he said.
Those expelled included two district vice presidents, a district secretary besides others.
On January 4, when the MP visited the district BJP office for organisational elections, these party men allegedly attacked him and also damaged his vehicle.
The MP did not file an FIR in this connection but had said that he would raise the matter before party leadership and had written a letter to state BJP president for disciplinary action against those involved in the act.
