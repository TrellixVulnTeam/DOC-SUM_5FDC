It is almost time for the Rio Olympics 2016, and all tech companies are trying to cash in on Olympics inspired accessories. Apple plans to sell Apple Watch bands in national flag colours of 14 countries when the games start in August. For example, if you are from the UK, you will be able to cheer your athlete or team while sporting a ‘Union Jack’ inspired wristband on your Apple Watch.
The catch, these national flag Apple wristbands will only be available in Brazil – specifically at the Apple Store at Village Mall (the sole location that will sell them) in Barra Da Tijuca, according to GQ. The report also states the bands will be available starting early August. The limited-edition nylon straps will be extremely exclusive, and only people who visit Brazil during the games will be able to get their hands on them.
At least one American athlete, Trayvon Bromell, was able to get his hands on a USA flag themed strap early, and can be seen wearing it on his hands in a Twitter picture he shared. The bands are reported to retail at $49 apiece.
Apple’s biggest competitor Samsung, has launched the limited Galaxy S7 edge Olympic Games Edition phone ahead of the 2016 games.
Samsung plans to sell 12,500 of these phones during the games for 879 euros (Rs 65,214 approx). The phone will be available in a black colour with metal frame on the sides. It features colours of the five official Olympic rings. The smartphone comes pre-installed with the Olympic Games theme UI, and wallpapers.
