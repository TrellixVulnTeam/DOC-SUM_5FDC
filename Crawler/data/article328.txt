The Rajasthan government Thursday offered protection to a key witness in the chinkara poaching case, and decided to appeal against Salman Khan’s acquittal in the Supreme Court, news channel NDTV reported.
The key witness in the poaching case Harish Dulani, who resurfaced on Wednesday, told media that he was forced into hiding after receiving threats. Dulani added that he stands by his statement made in the court against Salman.
“I have said what I wanted to say in courts. I was a driver with them for a week. I was threatened and hence I went out (of Jodhpur). I just need protection…I said what I wanted to say in courts, now I don’t want to comment on it. Yes, I stand by my statement and if court summons me, I will go. When was I missing?” Dulani said.
Dulani informed the Forest Department about the alleged chinkara poaching and recorded his statement before a magistrate. A lower court convicted Salman in 2006 in the poaching case, but its verdict was overturned by the Rajasthan High Court earlier this week over lack of evidence. 
Dulani claimed he was appointed as Salman’s driver during a film shooting in 1998, but the gypsy was being driven by Salman at the time of the alleged poaching. The defence counsel told court that Dulani is an unreliable witness and his earlier statement be struck down.
