Dehradun, Jun 26 (PTI) Coca Cola will set up a bottling plant in Sitarganj in 70 acres of land to be provided by the Uttarakhand government after the beverage giant had to cancel its plan to establish a unit at Chharba village in the state on environmental grounds, an official said today.
The company recently has asked the State Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (SIDCUL) to clear its stand on water, Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) and other issues in the 1,700-acre Sitarganj industrial estate.
"We have cleared their doubts and sent them detailed responses in this regard," Managing Director of SIDCUL R Rajesh Kumar said.
Earlier, he had said that Coca Cola was in the final phase of setting up its bottling plant in Sitarganj and land will be allotted to it.
"Coca Cola will set up the plant with the total investment of Rs 400-500 crore and has submitted an Earnest Money Deposit of Rs 1.26 crore," Kumar said.
According to Kumar, Coca Cola officials have completed field inspections and have hired a company as consultant on environmental issues.
