Chandigarh, Jun 18 (PTI) Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal has launched a special fund called 'Mukh Mantri Punjab Hepatitis C Relief Fund' to provide free treatment for patients affected by Hepatitis C.
With this initiative, Punjab has become the first state in the country to provide free treatment to confirmed cases of Hepatitis C, a spokesperson claimed.
Punjab government has created a special fund with an initial contribution of Rs 20 crore called the 'Mukh Mantri Punjab Hepatitis C Relief Fund' for this purpose.
Badal hoped that this initiative will go a long way to mitigate the woes of people suffering from Hepatitis C in general and their family in particular.
He further said the state government was committed to provide the best health care services to the people at affordable costs.
Director PGIMER and Head of the Hepatology department Yogesh Chawla, apprised Badal that several studies and reports had pointed out that there were a large number of cases of Hepatitis C in the state.
With a prevalence rate that could be as high as 3 per cent, there might be up to 10 lakh cases of suspected Hepatitis C, of which up to 6 lakh would require treatment.
Until recently, the treatment consisted of injectable peg-interferon which was very expensive and unaffordable.
"Free treatment for Hepatitis C will be provided to the patients in state government medical colleges of Patiala, Amritsar and Faridkot, besides 22 district hospitals, Principal Secretary Health & Family Welfare, Vini Mahajan, said.
