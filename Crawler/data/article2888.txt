Direct-to-home (DTH) players like Tata Sky and Videocon d2h are bringing internet browsing applications on their Set Top Box, which will enable subscribers to browse and interact on certain apps.


“This launch of gen-next HD Smart Set Top Box demonstrates our unrivalled expertise and innovation in creation, delivery and execution of technologically advanced products,” Videocon d2h Executive Chairman Saurabh Dhoot said in a statement. “This product promises to make your existing TV into a smart TV and ensure connectivity with the world. We are enabling convergence of TV, DTH and internet all in one place,” he said.
Tata Sky in a statement said the service will be available at no additional cost to Tata Sky subscribers, in the coming months. “We don’t look at ourselves as a DTH operator. We are a content distribution platform. The scope of that is defined by what content, which medium, what screen the subscriber wants. That is the level of convergence that Tata Sky is looking at achieving,” Tata Sky Chief Executive Officer Harit Nagpal said.
