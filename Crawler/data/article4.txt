Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday appealed to BJP workers in Telangana to carry out “Tiranga Yatra” on bikes from August 15 to September 17 across the state.
Telangana BJP has been demanding to hold official celebration of the ‘Hyderabad Liberation Day’ on September 17, when the erstwhile Nizam’s state was merged with Indian Union. The Hyderabad State under Nizam rule was merged with Indian Union on September 17, 1948 following a ‘police action’.
“September 17 is not Modi’s birthday… Sardar Patel got you freedom. Hence, carry out ‘Tiranga Yatra’ in all parts of the state,” Modi told party workers at packed L B Stadium in Hyderabad this evening. “Across the country, the ‘Tiranga Yatra’ will be conducted, but in Telangana you carry out the ‘Tiranga Yatra’ from August 15 till September 17 on bikes,” Modi said.
The PM had announced to launch a mega 15-day BJP campaign ’70 saal azadi-yaad karo kurbani’ on August 9, the 75th year of Quit India movement, and virtually the entire Council of Ministers will travel across the country to “rekindle the spirit of patriotism”.
Addressing the huge gathering, he said, “yeh sanghtan ki shakti ka nazara hai (This is a spectacle of the power of the organisation). Yeh BJP ke booth party ke karyakarta ki shakti ka nazara hai. (This is the spectacle of the power of the BJP’s booth party workers). Muze dur ka dikhai de raha hai (I can see the future). Telangana ka future nazar aa raha hai (I can visualise the future of Telangana). You too start seeing Telanagana with new future.”
