A TEAM of five students from India won three gold and two silver medals at the International Physics Olympiad held in Zurich this month.
In the team — which performed the best among teams from 84 nations — was Preey Shah (17) from Andheri, who won a gold medal.
Preey had developed an interest in the Physics Olympiad after he participated in the junior olympiad. He said working on a problem and researching on it was the most exciting part of preparing for the contest.
“The preparation process is really motivating and helped us work on our analytical skills,” said Preey.
After securing 93.2 per cent in his HSC exams, Preey has joined the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, for engineering in Computer Science.
He said there was a need to promote pure science among students and the olympiad was one way of doing so. The others in the team include Debaditya Pramanik from Kolkata, who also won a gold, Divyansh Garg from Jaipur, who won silver, Gowtham Amirthya S N from Hyderabad, who won gold, and Manan Bhatia from Lucknow, who won silver.
This was India’s second-best performance in its 19 years of participation, said Anwesh Mazumdar, National Coordinator for Science Olympiad. The team was felicitated at the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE), a national centre of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.
