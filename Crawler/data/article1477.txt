New Delhi, Jun 23 (PTI) Seemingly unrepentant, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy today said he will "suspend" his demand for sacking the chief economic advisor if the government considers him patriotic despite his attempts in the past of trying to twist India's arm.
A day after the government came out in strong defence of CEA Arvind Subramanian in face of his barrage of attack, Swamy tweeted this morning "If an Indian?, held patriotic, can advise a foreign nation where he works, to twist India's arm, is to be forgiven, then I suspend my demand".
"AS (Arvind Subramanian) to US Cong: "US initiatives by discriminating against India companies and exporters will exert pressure on India to open up" AS 13/3/13 !," Swamy tweeted.
Swamy yesterday caused a flutter when he sought Subramanian's sacking for allegedly taking anti-India stance when he was an IMF economist in Washington prior to joining the Finance Ministry.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley debunked Swamy's call for sacking Subramanian saying "Government has full confidence in CEA. His advice to government from time to time has been of great value".
Subramanian was appointed CEA by the BJP government in October 2014 after his predecessor Raghuram Rajan moved to the RBI as Governor in September 2013.
