Reality TV beauties Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian have reportedly been hit with a USD 10 million lawsuit by cosmetics company, Haven Beauty.
The sisters have been accused of backing out of a deal to represent their line of make-up, while the company has also asked a judge to block the sisters from speaking negatively of Haven, according to the gossip website TMZ.
Haven has based its eye-watering payout claim on the strength of some supposedly damaging remarks the sisters made as they allegedly performed a U-turn on their agreement.
