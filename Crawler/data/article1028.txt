Number of ministers well within limit: Naidu ||||
 Responding to criticism of the Cabinet expansion, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday said the size of the ministry is well within the prescribed limit. For a country of our size and the range of issues to be addressed... 78 ministers are certainly not many, he asserted. The Constitution limits the maximum size of the council of ministers at 82. ||||

COUNTERING CRITICISM on the expansion of the Union ministry, Venkaiah Naidu said Wednesday that the size of the ministry was well within the prescribed limit.
Addressing the media immediately after taking charge of the Information and Broadcasting ministry from his Cabinet colleague, Arun Jaitley, Naidu claimed that while most, including many opposition leaders, had positive comments on the reshuffle, a few, “who can see nothing good”, had criticised the move.
“For a country of our size and the range of issues to be addressed through effective coordination with state governments and third-tier institutions, 78 ministers are certainly not many,” he said.
On Smriti Irani’s apparent demotion from the HRD ministry to the textiles ministry, Naidu said, “One should not read too much into this. The person who you are talking about is also a dynamic person. I don’t think anybody is unhappy about this,” he said.
