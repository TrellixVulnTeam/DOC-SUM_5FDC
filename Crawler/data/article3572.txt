As many as 70 people involved in Maoist activities have surrendered in Sukma district, Chhattisgarh Police said on Thursday. Officers also said that in two separate incidents, 11 suspected Maoists have been arrested.
A statement released by the Sukma police said that those who surrendered were “tired of the hollow ideology of violence of the Maoists” and were influenced by the “police awareness” campaigns in the district. “Those who surrendered brought two country-made weapons, one pipe bomb, IEDs and other material. They were part of several Maoist organisations and are from Chintalnar, Morpalli, Lakhapal, Mukram, Tadmetla and other nearby villages.
People have participated with great enthusiasm in the surrender programme,” said the statement.
IG Bastar S R P Kalluri said, “In the Chintalnar police station area, 150 people from around half a dozen villages had shown interest in surrendering. Of these, 70 were found to be part of Maoist organisations, while the antecedents of the rest are being looked at.”
