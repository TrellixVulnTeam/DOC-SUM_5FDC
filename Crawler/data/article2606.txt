Two days after Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar made an appeal to all non-BJP parties to come together and pave the way for a Sangh-mukt Bharat, or RSS-free India, the BJP dared him to ban RSS in the state.
Reacting to Nitish’s attack on RSS, BJP Legislature Party leader Sushil Kumar Modi on Monday said, “The people of Bihar have given (the Nitish-led government) a mandate to establish rule of law and fight corruption, but he has chosen to attack the RSS in his national ambition. He has been trying to prepare grounds for imposing a ban on RSS. We dare him to do so.”

The Congress, Modi added, had “tried it once and seen the result.”
Modi, Nitish’s deputy when he was the CM of an NDA government in Patna, said Nitish had been with the NDA for 17 years and became a Union minister and Bihar CM when his JD(U) was an ally of the BJP. “Why did he not oppose the Sangh then,” he asked, adding that Nitish rose to prominence during the JP movement, which had the RSS’s support.
