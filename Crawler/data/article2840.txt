The wife and son of a man, who was killed in the 2002 hit-and-run case involving Salman Khan, moved the Supreme Court on Wednesday, challenging the acquittal of the actor by the Bombay High Court (HC) . Their appeal against the HC verdict is likely to come up for hearing on February 19 along with the petition filed by the Maharashtra government against Salman’s exoneration.
On September 28, 2002, Shaikh Noorulla Shafik was killed when the actor’s Land Cruiser crashed into a pavement outside a bakery in Mumbai’s Bandra area where several people, including Shafik, were sleeping. In December, the HC had acquitted the 50-year-old actor, saying there was not enough evidence that he was drunk that night and was driving the car.
Challenging the order, Shafik’s wife and son contended that the High Court has erred in not relying on the evidence on record, which they said, conclusively proved that Salman was drunk and was behind the wheels of the vehicle.
They also demanded compensation as victims of crime, saying they have been compelled to live in penury after Shafik’s death.
In her petition, Shafik’s wife said that she works as a domestic help and her son does menial jobs at construction sites.
On February 5, the Supreme court after hearing the state’s arguments for around 40 minutes, had said that it is still “making up its mind” on reopening the case and issue notice to the actor.
