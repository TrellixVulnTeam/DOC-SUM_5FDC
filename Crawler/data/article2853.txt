Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg says he is considering mounting an independent campaign for president.
Bloomberg told The Financial Times on Monday that he was “looking at all the options” when it comes to a bid.
The billionaire businessman said he found the current campaign to be “an insult to the voters.”
It’s the first time he acknowledged a possible run.
Bloomberg’s aides floated the idea last month that the former mayor could fill a gap in the center of the political spectrum.
He is distressed by the rise of Donald Trump and Texas Senator Ted Cruz among Republicans and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders among Democrats.
Bloomberg was a Democrat before becoming a Republican to run for mayor in 2001. He then became an independent.
