Six days after he was appointed advisor to Arunachal Pradesh Governor J P Rajkhowa, former Delhi Police Commissioner Y S Dadwal on Tuesday resigned from the post due to “personal reasons”. Former DG of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) B D Sharma has been appointed as Dadwal’s replacement.
On January 26, when the Centre brought Arunachal Pradesh under President’s Rule, Dadwal and retired IAS officer G S Patnaik were appointed as advisors to Rajkhowa.
“Dadwal tendered his resignation from the post of advisor to the Governor of Arunachal Pradesh today citing personal reasons. His resignation has been accepted by the government.
