Delhi-based think tank Vivekananda International Foundation (VIF) has scored once again with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting proposing the name of K G Suresh as the next director-general of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC).
Sources said that the I&B Ministry last week sent Suresh’s name to the Department of Personnel to replace Sunit Tandon whose term ended November. The ministry, not keen on continuing with Tandon, decided not to extend his fixed three-year tenure by another two years which is permissible under rules.
Suresh is serving in an honorary capacity as Senior Fellow with the New Delhi-based strategic think tank VIF. He is the foundation’s editor for website and in-house publications. He is currently posted as Senior Consulting Editor with Doordarshan News.
So far, the NDA government has picked from VIF its director Ajit Doval as National Security Adviser, executive council member Nripendra Misra as Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, distinguished fellow A Surya Prakash as Prasar Bharati chairman, and former DRDO chief V K Saraswat, who is dean of the Centre for Scientific and Technological Studies at VIF, as full time member of the Niti Aayog.
On its website, the organisation describes itself as an independent, non-partisan institution, but it is a project of the Vivekananda Kendra, an organisation founded by former RSS general secretary Eknath Ranade.
Suresh’s name was recommended by a selection panel comprising I&B secretary Sunil Arora and recent Padma Bhushan awardees and journalists Swapan Dasgupta and Rajat Sharma.
