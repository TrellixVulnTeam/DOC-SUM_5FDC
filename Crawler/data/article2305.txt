Chief of Pakistan’s banned JuD, Hafiz Saeed, has said his organisation will not allow destruction of Hindu temples and other holy places of non- Muslims in the country.

“We will not allow destruction of temples and other holy places of non-Muslims in the country,” he warned.
The Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief rejected allegations that his organisation is promoting extremism in Thar area of Sindh, which borders India, by opening seminaries in the poverty- stricken arid region.
Saeed also pledged support for Kashmiri Muslims, according to a Dawn report.
