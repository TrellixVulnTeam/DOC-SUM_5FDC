Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar Thursday said BJP is not serious about constructing the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, but is keeping the matter alive for political reasons. Nitish said the temple can be built only after a court verdict or through consensus between two communities.
Though the Bihar CM did not refer to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s recent statement on the construction of the temple, Nitish said: “They will talk of constructing the Ram Temple at the same site, but will not give dates. The BJP has only been trying to keep the issue alive”.
Talking to reporters here, Nitish said the BJP does not have “genuine respect for Ram”. “They just want to exploit people’s feelings for Ram. The party has hardly made efforts to sort out the (temple) issue, but uses it for political reasons at intervals”, said the Bihar CM. Notching up his attack, Kumar said the BJP has been treating Ram as if he were a party member.
This is the first time since the Bihar election results that Kumar has criticised the BJP.
The CM also said efforts are on to change the JD(U)’s symbol from arrow to ‘Chakra’ (wheel), as the party lost many seats because voters confused its symbol with that of other parties. Many JD(U) leaders had complained that candidates of JMM and Shiv Sena, having the bow and arrow as their symbol, got JD(U) votes in the recent Bihar elections.
