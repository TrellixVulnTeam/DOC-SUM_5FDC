Actor Salman Khan, in a major relief, has been acquitted in the blackbuck and chinkara poaching cases by the Rajasthan High Court on Monday. Salman was earlier sentenced to one-year and five-year imprisonment in respective cases by a local court and the order was challenged in High Court.
What was the case?
Salman Khan along with other actors including Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, and Sonali Bendre allegedly hunted down two blackbucks in Kankani village of Rajasthan on September, 1998. The incident happened during the shoot of ‘Hum Saath Saath hain’. The complaint was registered by Bishnoi community members on October 2 and the actor was taken into custody on October 12.
However, Salman was released on bail on October 17 and was later held guilty by a trial court in 2006 in the case. He was charged under the Widlife (Protection) Act and was given five years jail term as punishment and was asked to pay a fine of Rs 25,000. The actor then challenged Trial court’s decision in a sessions court which upheld it in 2007 and maintained the punishment.
The actor was also charged with two other poaching cases of Chinkara deer and black up in Bhawad village and Mathania village respectively.
The case was then taken to Rajasthan High Court which then stayed his sentence in 2013. The case was being heard since then and the court pronounced its final verdict on Monday and the actor was acquitted of all the charges.
