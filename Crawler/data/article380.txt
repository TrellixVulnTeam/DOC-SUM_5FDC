Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal accepted the invitation of Kolkata-based Missionaries of Charity on Wednesday to attend Mother Teresa’s sainthood ceremony on September 4 in Vatican City. The AAP leader will be joined by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee who earlier agreed to be present at the ceremony.
Mother Teresa, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, will be declared a saint by Pope Francis. She was beatified in 2003, considered as the first step to sainthood.
Earlier in March this year, Pope Francis announced that Mother Teresa would be canonized as a saint on September 4, on the eve of her 19th death anniversary. Mother Teresa died in 1997 at the age of 87.
Mother Teresa was born as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu to an Albanian family in Macedonia on August 26, 1910. She committed to be a nun in the year 1931 and chose the name Teresa. She taught at St. Mary’s High School in Kolkata till 1946.
By 1948, she left her nunhood and dedicated her life to serve the poor people living in slum areas. She founded the Missionaries of Charity in the year 1950 – a Roman catholic congregation with the purpose to serve the needs of the poorer sections of the society.
For her work, Mother Teresa was honored with the Nobel Peace Prize in the year 1979. But she chose to refuse the Nobel honour banquet. She asked for the $192,000 prize money to be used for helping the poor people of India.
