New Delhi, Jul 29 (PTI) Government today listed the much-awaited GST bill for consideration and passage in Rajya Sabha's agenda for the next week.
Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, while making a statement regarding government business for the week starting August 1 in the Upper House, said the Constitution (122nd Amendement) Bill, 2014 will be taken up for consideration and passage.
On July 27, the Cabinet had cleared changes in the legislation, dropping the controversial one per cent manufacturing tax and providing guarantee to compensate states for any revenue loss in the first five years of rollout of the ambitious indirect tax regime.
The government is keen to get the GST Bill approved during the Monsoon Session of Parliament ending on August 12.
The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha in May 2015 and vetted by the Rajya Sabha Select Committee.
However, the measure got stuck in the Upper House where the government does not have majority of its own, as the main opposition Congress sought certain changes in it.
Government is making efforts to hammer out a consensus on the bill and reaching out to opposition parties. Congress has described the exercise as "constructive and positive".
Once the Rajya Sabha clears the legislation, the amended legislation would be returned to the Lok Sabha for its approval.
