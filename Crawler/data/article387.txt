THE UNITED Kingdom’s new Minister for Asia, Alok Sharma, Tuesday said there are no legal grounds to return the Kohinoor.
This comes amid reports that the NDA government is discussing ways to mount a campaign to get the prized diamond back from the UK.
Responding to a question on Kohinoor, Sharma, on his maiden visit within a week of taking charge, said, “It is the UK government’s (view) that there are no legal grounds for restitution.”
He was referring to the UN convention on restitution of cultural property, which has been the guiding principle on such matters since it was adopted in 1970.
