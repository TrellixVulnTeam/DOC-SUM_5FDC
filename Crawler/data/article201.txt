New Delhi, Aug 4 (PTI) The AAP government today said it will challenge the High Court order holding that the Lieutenant Governor is the administrative head of the National Capital Territory as it "undermined" the powers of the council of ministers given by the Constitution.
"We will move the Supreme Court against the HC verdict," Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain said today.
The Minister alleged said that the Kejriwal government has been prevented by the Centre from taking any action against corruption since it was formed.
A Delhi government spokesperson said that initial assessment of Delhi High Court verdict shows it has "undermined powers of council of ministers mentioned in the Constitution".
Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Raghav Chadha said that the High Court verdict will be challenged in the Supreme Court, adding that "a democratically elected government cannot be undermined. This isn't a fight for supremacy, but democracy".
The High Court today said that LG is the administrative head of National Capital Territory and the AAP Government's contention that he is bound to act on the advice of Council of Ministers was "without substance".
The decision comes after months-long turf war between LG Najeeb Jung and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.
A bench of Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice Jayant Nath dismissed AAP Government's plea challenging the Centre's May 21, 2015, notification giving absolute powers to LG in appointing bureaucrats in the national capital.
