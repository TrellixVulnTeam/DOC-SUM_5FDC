Hyderabad, Jun 24 (PTI) The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) today said a production of 270 million tons of foodgrainsï¿½was expected during the kharif and rabi seasons this year, thanks to the forecast of a normal monsoon.
Director General, ICAR, T Mohapatra, made the announcement while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of 23rd ICAR Regional Committee Meeting here.
"270 million tons production is forecast this year due to normal monsoon," he said.
He said that several rice varieties which can withstand heavy downpour have been developed by researchers, and submergence-tolerant rice varieties like `Swarna sub 1' should be cultivated to withstand heavy rains/flash flood situations.
Similar "calamity-tolerant" varieties were being developed by Centre for Rice Research Institute, Bhubaneshwar, he said.
ICAR was also getting ready to commercialise rice varieties 'Bina Dhan 8' and 'Bina Dhan 10', he said.
Mohapatra said even though there was normal monsoon this year, cotton cultivation in rain-fed areas should be discouraged.
Regarding GM technologies, he said ICAR was increasing investment in research to resolve bio safety analysis issues.
