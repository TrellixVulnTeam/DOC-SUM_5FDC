The Build-up
Face-to-face with men who rule the world

Two teams undergoing transition square off as India take on Australia in an important limited-overs series beginning Tuesday.
Saw Sran in the IPL, he was impressive: Smith

He may be an unknown entity in international cricket but Barinder Sran is not quite unfamiliar to Australian captain Steve Smith, who says the rookie pacer has impressive variations in his armoury and was discussed in the dressing room.
Harsha Bhogle: India’s performance depends on Kohli, Dhoni roles

If Virat Kohli can slip back into the role of a lieutenant, if he can keep looking up to MS Dhoni as leader, it will make the team stronger.
