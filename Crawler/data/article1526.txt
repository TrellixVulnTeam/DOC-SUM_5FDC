Actor Kamaal R Khan is known for his outrageous comments on Twitter and Facebook, and of course for rubbing people the wrong way. The Deshdrohi actor has an opinion on almost everything, and everyone. So, it wasn’t surprising for many when KRK, as he he popularly known, took to Twitter and Facebook to share a rather unusual post on Father’s Day today (June 19).
Following one of the top-trending hashtags of the day, the 41-year-old tweeted: “My father harassed me, beat me like an animal n kicked my ass almost everyday in my childhood so #HappyFathersDay to my kick ass father.”

He posted the same message on his Facebook page, which was further shared hundreds of times, and also elicited a lot of reactions from followers — most were quite censorious towards him as well as his brand of humour.

Though KRK’s Father’s Day message stuck out like a sore thumb amid a barrage of sentimental messages by celebrities about their fathers, the tonality of it does bring to the fore a serious issue of the prevalence of parental abuse in society.
We’re not sure whether the post was meant in jest or a reflection of KRK’s troubled childhood, but much like the actor’s propensity to opine on everything, a look at the comments on his posts show that this time, the Internet has a decisive opinion on him.
