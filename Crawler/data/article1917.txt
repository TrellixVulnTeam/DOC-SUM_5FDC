The Nagaland Unit of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has been launched at Dimapur in the presence of AAP National Executive Committee member and observer North Eastern States, Habung Payeng.
Altogether 13 officials were elected to the executive body of the state unit of AAP with Dr S Amos Longkumer as the coordinator and Riikhietuonuo as secretary.
Interacting with media persons in Dimapur yesterday, Habung Payeng said that Naga people were fed up of regional party and wanted a change.
He said that Congress party was also non-existent as its elected members have joined the regional party government due to some personal interest. Therefore, he said AAP would be the alternative party for the people seeking a change, adding that “AAP builds leaders and does not look for leaders.”
AAP spokesperson Lemwang Chuhwanglim said that the launching of AAP party in the state was an achievement for young people. In a state where people talk only of issues instead of tackling them, AAP will let people see what and how much the party does for the state, he said.
The AAP’s first and foremost objective will be on the education of the rights of the people as many are not aware of their rights and schemes, the party workers said.
