Ever since Shah Rukh Khan's 2015 film release Dilwale failed to create its magic at the box office due to a clash with Ranveer Singh's Bajirao Mastani, the 50-year-old actor has been avoiding a repetition of the same. And this very reason made him and makers of his next film Raees postpone the release of the film. SRK's much-awaited film Raees was expected to hit the screens with Salman Khan's Sultan this Eid. But they later pushed the release date to January 2017. But now, Raees will have to face Hrithik Roshan's Kaabil at the box office as the two are slated to release on January 26, 2017. And King Khan is doing everything possible to avoid the clash.

And if sources are to be believed, Khan has been able to convince Senior Roshan to change the release date of Kaabil.
 
According to a report in Mid-Day , Roshan has decided to vacate the January 26 slot for Raees.
A source was d as telling the tabloid, "After initial discussions about avoiding a box office collision, Monday night's marathon meeting ended on a positive note. Neither party wanted their film to suffer. Kaabil's release is likely to be postponed and Raees will get a clear window."
In fact, the Fan actor also hinted that he has been able to convince the producer when he tweeted about his visit to the Roshans.

Initially, the Kaabil makers were reluctant to change the release date. In fact, director Sanjay Gupta had tweeted that Kaabil will release on January 26 next year and there is no change in its release date.
But it seems Shah Rukh has worked his way out of this difficult situation. Now we can only wait for an official statement from the makers.
