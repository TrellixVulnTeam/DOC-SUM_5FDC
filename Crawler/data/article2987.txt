Additional DGP R Sreelekha, the first woman IPS officer from Kerala cadre, has blamed another ADGP-rank officer of harassing her for the past 29 years.
In a Facebook post, Sreelekha alleged that ADGP Tomin J Thachankery has been “haunting” her “since the IPS training period in 1987”, and that he was behind the recent Vigilance probe against her in connection with a vehicle tax evasion case.
Thachankery refuted the allegations, calling them baseless.
The Vigilance Court in Thrissur had recently ordered a probe against Sreelekha, a former transport commissioner, in the case.
In her Facebook post, Sreelekha said the incident that led to the case had taken place when ADGP Rishi Raj Singh was the transport commissioner, but the complaint had come up when Thachankery joined the post later. “Thachankery conspired with the complainant to implicate me… ”Sreelekha wrote.
She posted that she has “become ill” following this “mental harassment from Thachankery”. She also alleged that Thachankery was responsible for leaking the confidential report from the Vigilance Deputy Superintendent to the complainant.
Refuting the allegations, Thachankery said, “Everyone in the department knows who has been haunting whom over the years. I will bring her post to the notice of higher-ups.”
