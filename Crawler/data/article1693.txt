Move to raise professors' workload rolled back ||||
 The HRD Ministry on Wednesday confirmed the restoration of teaching workload of the assistant professors, associate professors and professors back to 16, 14 and 14 hours per week, respectively. This comes after the teaching community protested against the UGC's move to increase the professors' workload to 18, 16, and 16 hours per week, besides another six hours of additional work. ||||

THE UNIVERSITY Grants Commission (UGC) gave in to some of the major demands of the protesting teachers on Wednesday and amended its regulations regarding Academic Performance Index (API) — a mandatory requirement for universities and colleges to select and promote faculty members — to restore the direct teaching hours workload.
In other words, there will be no change in workload. An assistant professor will have to teach 16 hours per week, associate professors and professors will have to log in 14 hours of teaching, higher education secretary V S Oberoi told reporters at a press conference held after the UGC meeting. Direct teaching hours will include tutorials and hours spent on practicals/project supervision.

Oberoi also held out an assurance that there will be no retrenchment of teachers on account of API and workload criteria, including those who are teaching ‘ad-hoc’.
“Mentoring by professors and teachers will also be recognised while calculating direct teaching score,” he said.
The UGC, however, has retained the provision that gives students the right to participate in their teachers’ appraisal.
The higher education regulator had recently changed the API criteria which had led to continuous protests by teachers as it was feared they could lead to retrenchment.
