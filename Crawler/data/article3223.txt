THE VERSOVA police station on Sunday registered an FIR against actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui after a woman residing in the same housing society as the actor, approached them alleging that the actor had pushed her and behaved inappropriately following a dispute over parking space. The actor was charged under section 354 of the IPC that deals with assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty.
The complainant said that her 24-year-old daughter had been manhandled by the actor, his brother and support staff on Sunday afternoon. “Our society has been having a dispute with Nawazuddin who started staying in our society nearly a year back, since he had completely occupied the parking space of the building. Today, when my daughter went to click photographs of the actor again occupying the parking space, he along with his brother and support staff manhandled her and physically pushed her,” the complainant told The Indian Express.

Soon after the incident, the complainant and her daughter went to the Versova police station to complaint. Finally at around 6pm, the Versova police registered an FIR on the basis of the complaint given by her. The complainant stays on the fourth floor of the building while Siddiqui stays on the ground floor. She said that they had given notices to Siddiqui in the past as well to vacate the compound space but that amounted to nothing.
