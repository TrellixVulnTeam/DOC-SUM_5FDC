The Indian Space Research Organisation Wednesday put Singapore’s first commercial earth-observation satellite in space through a launch on the polar satellite launch vehicle (PSLV). The TeLEOS-I, a 400-kg satellite, was joined by five other smaller satellites, all from Singapore, on the PSLV-C29 mission.
The six satellites, which together weight about 624 kg, were deposited into an orbit of 549 km from the earth’s surface.
TeLEOS was the first one to be deployed in the orbit after a flight of about 18 minutes and 12 seconds. It was followed by the other five satellites in quick succession within the next three minutes. The launch took place from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota at 6 pm.
These six satellites took the count of foreign satellites launched by ISRO to 57. PM Narendra Modi congratulated ISRO scientists on the successful launch.
