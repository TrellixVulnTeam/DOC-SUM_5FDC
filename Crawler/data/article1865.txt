A survey that looked into the pattern of hospital admissions in Delhi found that infections, including all types of fevers, accounted for as many as 38 per cent of cases that needed hospitalisation.
Injuries, including those sustained in road traffic accidents, came a distant second, accounting for nearly 14 per cent of total admissions. Musculoskeletal problems or joint diseases, which comprised 12 per cent of total hospital admissions, was in third place.
These figures were part of the latest survey on ‘social consumption’ on health, released by Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia Thursday. The report on the survey’s findings was presented by the Delhi government’s Directorate of Economics and Statistics, and was based on the result of the National Sample Survey’s 71st round on health and morbidity, carried out between January and June 2014.
The survey also found that admissions in government hospitals in rural areas decreased from 46.4 per cent during the last survey, conducted in 2004, to 18.06 per cent in 2014. Admissions in government hospitals decreased despite a drop in costs — from Rs 14,477 in NSSO’s 2014 survey to Rs 2,615 in 2014.
Sisodia pointed out that the rate of hospitalisation, including for child birth, per thousand population was 41 in urban Delhi. “This is lower than the national average of 49, thereby indicating relatively better health profile in urban Delhi,” he said. Cardiovascular diseases comprised a little over 6 per cent of hospital admissions, while respiratory diseases accounted for 4.67 per cent.
Psychiatric and neurological diseases also contributed significantly to hospital admissions, accounting for nearly 4.7 per cent of them.
In rural areas of the capital, only 26.7 per cent patients received treatment in out-patient departments. The percentage of admission in government hospitals was even lower in rural areas — a little over 18 per cent — while the national average of such admission is 41.9 per cent.
Compared to this, the cost of treatment in private hospitals in rural areas has spiked from Rs 22,375 to Rs 37,692. Government hospital admissions dipped in urban areas as well — though not as drastically — from 58.8 per cent to 51.39 per cent.
