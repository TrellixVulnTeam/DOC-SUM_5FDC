New Delhi, July 3 (ANI): Taking a dig at the Congress Patry over reports that Priyanka Gandhi might take part in the election campaign for next year's Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday said it shows that vice-president Rahul Gandhi had failed.
BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra also took a jibe at the grand old party, saying that in the Congress 'family is the party' and that the hunt for leadership is also limited to the Gandhi family.
"Congress is eager to bring in Priyanka Gandhi for UP, it is their internal matter. It makes three things clear. One is that the Congress can never come out of its family, they even want leadership in Gandhi family." Patra told ANI.
"Congress' attempt to bring in Priyanka shows that Rahul Gandhi has failed. If Rahul had succeeded that there would not have been called Priyanka," he added.
According to reports, Congress has finally decide to draft Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to head its election campaign for next year's Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.
