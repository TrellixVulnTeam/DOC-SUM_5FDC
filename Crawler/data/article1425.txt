Seoul, Jun 24 (PTI) At the end of its two-day plenary here, the NSG today declared its "firm support" for the "full, complete and effective" implementation of the NPT as the cornerstone of the international non-proliferation regime, a clear indication that no exception will be made in the case of India.
The statement by the 48-nation grouping, however, said that it will continue to have discussions on participation of countries which have not signed the Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Confirming that the India's application was discussed during the two-day deliberations, the statement, under a sub-heading 'Outreach', said it shared information on all aspects of the 2008 Statement on Civil Nuclear Cooperation with India and discussed the NSG relationship with India.
"Participating Governments reiterated their firm support for the full, complete and effective implementation of the NPT as the cornerstone of the international non-proliferation regime," it said.
The NSG had discussions on the issue of 'Technical, Legal and Political Aspects of the Participation of non-NPT States in the NSG' and decided to continue its discussion, the statement said.
A special meeting last night had discussed India's application where China and a number of other countries opposed its entry into NSG saying it was not a signatory of the NPT.
