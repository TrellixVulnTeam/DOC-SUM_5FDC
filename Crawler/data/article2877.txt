Nida Fazli wrote the title song of TV serials like ‘Sailaab’, ‘Neem ka Ped’, ‘Jaane Kya Baat Hui’ and ‘Jyoti’. The composition “Koi Akelaa Kahaan” is another popular composition sung by Kavita Krishnamurthy.
He also worked with late ghazal singer Jagjit Singh in 1994 and together they brought out an album ‘Insight’, which got appreciation for its soulful poetry and music.

He has also written famous ghazals ‘kabhie kisi ko mukamil jahan na milta’ (ahista ahista),  ‘Aa bhi jaa, aa bhi jaa’ (Sur), ‘Tu Is Tarah Se Meri Zindagi Mein’ (Aap To Aise Na The), ‘Hosh Waalon Ko Khabar Kya’ (Sarfarosh).
Fazli’s daughter confirmed the poet’s demise, a member of the organising team of upcoming Urdu festival Jashn-e-Rekhta told IANS. Fazli was a key guest at the festival.
Sanjiv Saraf, founder of Rekhta Foundation, said that Fazli’s death has “left a space that can never be filled”.
“Nida Fazli gave expression to the angst of the common people in simple but aesthetically powerful and nuanced language. His dohas enjoyed great popularity,” Saraf said.
Filmmaker John Mathew Matthan, who directed “Sarfarosh” — the movie which featured “Hoshwalon ko khabar kya” penned by Fazli, told IANS: “It’s a great loss for this film industry. He was such a renowned poet. Coincidentally, today is also Jagjit Singh’s birth anniversary and I have worked with both of them in my film ‘Sarfarosh’.”
On Twitter, a string of film celebrities condoled Fazli’s death and recounted some of his works. Here’s what they said:
Lata Mangeshkar: Aaj mashhoor Shayar Nida Fazli sahab ka inteqal hua is baat mujhe bahut dukh hai. Allah unhe jannat ataa farmaaye ye meri dili dua.
