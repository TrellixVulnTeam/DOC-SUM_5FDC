Microsoft gives OneDrive users 15GB free storage ||||
 Following a petition that garnered over 70,000 votes, Microsoft has once again allowed OneDrive users to have 15GB of free storage. Last month, the company had reduced OneDrives free storage capacity from 15GB to 5GB. However, the said change is not automatic and users will still need to opt-in by January 31 to keep their free storage. ||||

Microsoft last month announced its plans to reduce the free OneDrive storage from 15GB to 5GB. Apart from the free storage, Microsoft also took the plug off its unlimited storage tier offered to Office 365 subscribers.
In a backlash to this move, a petition requesting Microsoft to “give us back our storage” at OneDrive feedback site received over 70,000 votes and the company has now responded.
“We’ve heard clearly from our Windows and OneDrive fans about the frustration and disappointment we have caused. We realize the announcement came across as blaming customers for using our product. For this, we are truly sorry and would like to apologize to the community,” says Douglas Pearce, Group Manager, Microsoft in a reply to the petition.

While Microsoft isn’t bringing back the unlimited storage, it will allow OneDrive users to keep their 15GB of free storage in addition to 15GB camera roll offered as a bonus. The additional storage won’t reflect automatically, OneDrive users rather have to opt-in to keep their storage.
For OneDrive users using more than 5GB of free space and affected by last month’s storage cut, Microsoft is offering free one year subscription to Office 365 Personal which offers 1TB of OneDrive storage in addition to Microsoft Office suite. Also Microsoft plans to refund all Office 365 subscribers unhappy with Microsoft’s move.
Microsoft’s Douglas Pearce adds, “We are all genuinely sorry for the frustration this decision has caused and for the way it was communicated.” While Microsoft has taken almost a month to respond to user queries, the decision should please its OneDrive fans.
