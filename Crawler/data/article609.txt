Visitors to Dubai have a new way to keep cool during the scorching Mideast summer. The company behind the cityâ€™s indoor ski slope plans to let guests stay overnight in tents on the man-made snow on Fridays starting from July 29.
For 750 dirhams ($204) a person, campers will get after-hours access to the slopes and refreshments, including hot chocolate before bedding down in tents and sleeping bags to keep out the artificial chill. Breakfast is in an adjacent Alpine-themed cafe.
The man-made Ski Dubai attraction opened in 2005 in the Mall of the Emirates shopping complex.
Its operator says overnight visitors can expect temperatures of -4 degrees Celsius (25 F). Weather outside Monday was a fairly typical 43 C (109 F).
