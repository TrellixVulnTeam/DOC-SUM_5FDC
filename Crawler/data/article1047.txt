The court also ordered Messi to pay a fine of around 2 million euros ($2.21 million) and his father to pay 1.5 million euros for the crimes.

Messi maintained that he knew nothing about an alleged tax evasion scheme when he signed contracts related to image rights. Lionel and Jorge Horacio Messi were accused by the Spanish tax office of defrauding the government of 4.2 million euros ($4.7 million) between 2007 and 2009.
