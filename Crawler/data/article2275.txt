In a faux pas, the Goa Traffic Police has issued challan to a car driver for not wearing helmet while driving.
Police Sub-Inspector S L Hunashikatti, attached to the traffic cell in Colva, issued the challan on Tuesday to one Eknath Anant Palkar for not wearing helmet when he was driving his car in a village near South Goa’s Colva beach.
Palkar was booked under section 177 of Motor Vehicle Act which deals with riding two-wheeler without wearing helmet.
A senior police officer attached to the traffic cell said it could be an error as the same section deals with other offences.
“The section 177 of MV Act also deals with driving without valid licence. By mistake the officer must have mentioned it as driving without helmet,” he said.
“No policeman would be foolish to issue challan to a car driver for not wearing helmet,” he added
