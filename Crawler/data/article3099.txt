Three days after three girl students of a private medical college in Villupuram committed suicide, accusing the management of “torture” and charging excess fees, the owner of the institution surrendered before a Chennai court on Monday.
Vasuki Subramanian, the owner of SVS Yoga Medical College in Kallakurichi, about 170 km from Chennai, was remanded in judicial custody for 15 days. The bodies of E Saranya and V Priyanka, both 18, and T Monisha, 19, were recovered from a well near the college on Saturday. In a suicide note, the three blamed Subramanian for their deaths.
In Villupuram, the preliminary postmortem reports of two of the girls revealed drowning as the cause of death. Police said the report ruled out any possibility of murder and that the post-mortem did not find external injuries.
While the parents of Saranya and Priyanka received their bodies after post-mortem, Monisha’s father approached the Madras High Court seeking a CB-CID probe into the deaths and a second autopsy to be conducted by two doctors.
The court said only the government could take a decision on the probe, but ordered that Monisha’s body be preserved at the Villupuram medical college until further orders.
