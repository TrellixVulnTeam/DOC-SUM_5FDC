Expelled former DMK strongman M K Alagiri on Tuesday said he will not support any party in the May 16 Assembly polls in Tamil Nadu.
“No support for anyone. That’s all,” was the Madurai leader’s cryptic response when reporters asked him whom he will support in the coming election.
“It applies to my supporters also,” he added.
In 2014 Lok Sabha polls, leaders, including MDMK founder Vaiko and BJP’s H Raja had called on Alagiri in an apparent effort to get his support.
Vaiko had contested from Virudhunagar and Raja from Sivaganga, both South Tamil Nadu constituencies.
Alagiri, elder son of DMK president M Karunanidhi, had enjoyed tremendous clout as party’s Organisation Secretary South, when DMK was in power between 2006 and 2011.
However, he fell out of favour with the party leadership following a power tussle with younger sibling M K Stalin, resulting in his suspension and expulsion later.
Alagiri had recently called on Karunanidhi in Chennai, triggering speculation of his homecoming but Stalin had dismissed any such move, saying there was no politics behind the meeting.
