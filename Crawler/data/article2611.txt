The Congress on Monday alleged that some BJP leaders, including a few in the government, were behind the violence during the three days of arson in large parts of Haryana during the recent pro-reservation agitation by the Jat community. This comes on the heels of a probe panel finding that hundreds of policemen had deserted their posts, ignored orders and sided with the protesters during the agitation.
Congress general secretary Shakeel Ahmad said the party’s state unit had passed a resolution earlier, stating that BJP leaders, and some in the government, had engineered the violence. “Now Prakash Singh panel has also found that there was complete failure of the state government.”
Pointing out that the panel has found many police officials’ involvement in the agitation, Ahmad said, “There cannot be a more unfortunate development for any government than this.”
The Congress was reacting to The Indian Express report about the panel’s finding that on average 60-70 policemen deserted their posts in each district, even as mobs went on a rampage
Ahmad said the violence was engineered to “divert attention from the failures of the government.” “For a year, a BJP MP had been making statements against a particular community and caste. Neither Chief Minister M L Khattar nor PM Narendra Modi took note…or act. An MP accused of fanning tension in Muzaffarnagar in the wake of the riots had gone to Haryana. Why had he gone there? The question should be put to Khattar and BJP leaders,” he said.
