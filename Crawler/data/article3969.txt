Prominent Sunni Muslim leader Kanthapuram Aboobacker Musliyar Saturday said gender equality was “against Islam”.
Addressing a Sunni students’ camp in Kozhikode, the orthodox Sunni leader said, “Where has man-woman equality taken place? It is not going to happen. Gender equality is against Islam, society and human kindness.”
“The world is controlled by men. Women have strength in other areas… They can deliver babies. Only women can nurture babies. Her duty is to rear children and feed the husband,’’ Musliyar said.
Claiming that women do not have “courage”, Musliyar asked if there is a woman doctor who can perform a major surgery.
“Women doctors can do general medicine or manage pediatrics. But they don’t have the courage for big surgical interventions,’’ he said.
Referring to a recent controversy over segregation of girls and boys in a Muslim-run college, the orthodox Muslim leader said the demand that girls and boys be allowed to sit together was meant to destroy Islam.
He said that the allegation of a Muslim woman journalist that children used to be sexually abused at madrasas was baseless, and added that those who raise the allegation should bring forth evidence.
Musliyar has a history of making controversial observations over women issues and their role in society.
He had recently come out against women reservation in local governing bodies. He had also advocated marriage of minor girls to ensure morality and discipline in society.
