Airtel has announced a new scheme offering prepaid consumers the freedom to use data plans without any fear of their validity period expiring before the plans are used. The company claims these new data plans with unrestricted validity are a first in the Indian market.
Ajai Puri, Director – Market Operations, Bharti Airtel said these unrestricted validity data plans “give prepaid customers the flexibility to enjoy mobile internet services without worrying about any validity restrictions”.
The three new tariff plans are available for Airtel’s prepaid mobile customers in Delhi and Mumbai starting December 24. Airtel mobile customers in other cities will be able to avail the same from December 29.
However, the catch seems to be the fact the largest of these plans is a measly 110MB which on a 4G network won’t take more than a couple of days to complete.
Airtel unlimited validity option is available for 2G, 3G and 4G.
