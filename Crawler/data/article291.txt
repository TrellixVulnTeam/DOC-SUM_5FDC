Higher revenue expenditure on account of front-loading of subsidy payments pushed the Centre’s fiscal deficit for the first three months of FY17 to about R3.26 lakh crore or 61.1% of the full-year target of R5.34 lakh crore. In the same period last year, the deficit was 51.6% of the corresponding annual target.
The quality of the Centre's fiscal deficit worsened in Q1FY2017 as compared to the year-ago period, with a year-on-year decline in its capital spending, critical to economic activity revival. Capital expenditure — including Plan and non-Plan components — stood at Rs 48,996 crore or 19.8% of the full-year target in Q1 this year as against Rs 58,609 crore (24.3%) in the corresponding quarter last fiscal.
Plan expenditure, however, stood at Rs 1.47 lakh crore or 26.8% of the full-year estimate, an improvement compared to Rs 1.15 lakh crore (24.7%) in the year-ago period. Spending on rural development, urban development, agriculture and human resource development topped under this category.
Thanks to front-loading of subsidy outgo for food, fertiliser and fuel, non-Plan expenditure stood at Rs 3.64 lakh crore in Q1FY17, or 25.5% of the full year target as compared to Rs 3.16 lakh crore, or 24.1% of the previous year's target during the quarter.
The April-June net tax collection was Rs 1.57 lakh crore, which is 14.9% of the estimate for the full year; in the corresponding period a year ago, the same stood at Rs 1.02 lakh crore or 11.1% of that year’s target. Revenue receipts during April-June were Rs 1.85 lakh crore, or 12.8% of the full-year target; in the same period last year, revenue receipts were 11.1% of the full-year target.
According to the data compiled by the Controller General of Accounts, the total expenditure was Rs 5.12 lakh crore in April-June or 25.9% of the budget estimate (BE) for the full year. Total expenditure in the corresponding period last year was Rs 4.3 lakh crore, or 24.2% of the BE.
“The receipts realised from tax revenues, spectrum auction proceeds and disinvestment would crucially affect the fiscal turnout in 2016-17, in light of the rise in expenditure related to the pay commission's recommendations,” said Aditi Nayar, senior economist, ICRA.
