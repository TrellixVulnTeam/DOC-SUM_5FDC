India defeated the Proteas by 337 runs in the fourth and final Test to win the series 3-0 at the Ferozeshah Kotla in New Delhi on Monday.
Chasing a mammoth target of 481 runs, the visitors were bowled out for 143.
India won the first Test by 108 runs at Mohali and the third match by 124 runs in Nagpur. The second match at Bengaluru was called off due to rain.

BCCI’s all top bosses are in the city to attend a governing council meeting of the Indian Premier League (IPL).
As a result of the win, India climbed to the second position in the International Cricket Council (ICC) Test rankings. South Africa still retain the No.1 position in the Test rankings.
