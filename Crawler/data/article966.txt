Top Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Muzaffar Wani was among the three militants killed by security forces in Anantnag, Jammu-Kashmir on Friday.
J&K police chief K Rajendra confirmed that Burhan was killed in an exchange of fire between security personnel and militants. He was cornered in Bumdoora village of Kokernag today morning by a joint team of police and Army. Among those killed, one was identified as Sartaj Ahmed Sheikh and another is yet to be ascertained. 
Meanwhile, Separatist leaders Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Asiya Andrabi gave a call for complete shutdown in Jammu and Kashmir tomorrow to protest against Burhan’s killing.
Burhan joined the militant outfit in 2010, when he was just 15 years of age. He was considered as the ‘poster boy’ of the Hizbul Mujahideen.

Burhan was among the new wave of tech-savy militants who used to leverage social media to recruit and influence Kashmiri youth. His family currently lives in Tral. Burhan’s elder brother Khalid was also shot dead by the Army last year. Burhan carried a cash reward of Rs 10 lakh on his head.
Last month, the 21-year-old commander Burhan released a video warning of attacks on separate colonies for Sainiks and Kashmiri Pandits if they are set up in the Valley. The major part of the video message, however, was directed at the J&K Police warning them of more attacks.
