For a mid-week release, Sultan’s collections at Rs 36.54 crore on day one were huge. The fact that this is the money the film made on a day which was not even Eid (the festival was shifted to July 7) is even more exemplary. Prior to this, the star’s Ek Tha Tiger held the record for mid-week release with over Rs 32 crore in ticket sales. It seems all Sultan needs to do now is to keep its focus on the big number. And hope for audience’s love. (Photos: Sultan Is 2016’s Highest Opener At The Box Office. SRK’s Fan, Akshay’s Housefull 3 follow)
