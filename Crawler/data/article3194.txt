Fulfilling a key election promise of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, the Bihar cabinet today gave the green signal to 35 per cent reservation for women in state government jobs.
“The crucial decision was taken at the cabinet meeting today. There will now be provision for 35 per cent reservation to women of all categories in all kinds of government jobs,” said Brajesh Mehrotra, Principal Secretary (Cabinet).
The decision marked Nitish’s first big step in this direction in nearly 10 years after unveiling 50 per cent reservation for women in panchayat and local body polls in 2006.

In the latest decision, the government said, the 35 per cent reservation extended to women on posts of police constable would now be extended to cover other state government vacancies, too.
The cabinet also gave the go-ahead to rules paving way for the Right to Public Grievances Redressal Bill, which is likely to be implemented in May, a target set by the Chief Minister.
Nitish had frequently referred to his promise of reservation for women during the bitterly fought 2015 Assembly elections.
But the Opposition BJP criticised the government for announcing “populist schemes that would not serve any purpose”. “Nitish Kumar derides BJP by saying that we could only beat our chests in frustration for five years. But the CM saying that there is rule of law does not mean that there is rule of law in the state… The mandate to Nitish Kumar is to deliver on promises,” said BJP leader and former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi.
