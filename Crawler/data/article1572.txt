Mirzapur, Jun 18 (PTI) Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar today promised total prohibition on the lines of his state if the people of Uttar Pradesh "strengthen" his hands in the 2017 Assembly elections.
"Prohibition is necessary for the country and society...if the people here strengthen our hands, we will implement it here as well," the JD(U) leader said at a public meeting at Shivshankari Dham, about 40 km from here.
"When the women of Bihar asked me to put an end to liquor, I said if our government comes back, it will be done and we fulfilled our promise," said Nitish.
He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been moving about and giving speeches whereas, his government has done nothing in the last two years. "None of the election promises has been kept," he said.
Commenting on the alleged Hindu migration in Kairana in western UP, Nitish said the communal atmosphere in UP is vitiated at the time of elections.
