The Congress Monday accused the NDA government of obstructing, delaying and defeating judicial appointments by stealth and claimed that the relationship between the executive and judiciary was now in tatters.
It alleged that the government was hitting back at the judiciary for striking down the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act by delaying appointment of judges.
The Indian Express had first reported about the government’s decision not to accept many crucial recommendations and observations made by the Supreme Court collegium regarding the draft memorandum of procedure (MoP), which would guide appointments to the higher judiciary. The government had also asked the Intelligence Bureau to carry out a “more stringent” background check on all names recommended by the collegium for elevation.
