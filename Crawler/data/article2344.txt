Development Fee discontinued at IGI Airport ||||
 The Development Fee charged from passengers flying out from the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi has been discontinued beginning May 1. The Delhi International Airport Limited was earlier allowed to charge each passenger 100 for domestic and 600 for international flights. The fee was reportedly levied so that the financial gap in developing the airport could be recovered. ||||

Flying out of IGI Airport in New Delhi has got cheaper from Sunday with the discontinuation of the development fee being charged from each passenger for the past several years.
Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), the joint venture company which runs the IGI airport, was allowed to levy Rs 100 per flight as Development Fee (DF) from passengers flying on domestic routes and Rs 600 from those flying to international destinations.
The airports tariff regulator Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) had in February issued an order directing DIAL to discontinue DF from May 1, after having allowed it to levy DF through a December 2012 order.
Citing the average monthly collection of Rs 30 crore as DF, the AERA had in its order in February said the total sanctioned DF amount of Rs 3,415.35 crore was likely to be recovered by April 30, 2016. To cover the financial gap in developing the airport, the allowable DF was determined at Rs 3,415.35 crore.
Last month, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had also asked all airlines operating from Delhi to refund the development fee charged from passengers flying out of the IGI Airport on the tickets booked for journey beyond April 30.
DIAL is a joint venture between GMR group, Airports Authority of India and Germany’s Fraport AG.
