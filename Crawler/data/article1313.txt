Anushka Sharma – who has teamed up with Diljit Dosanjh for her next film Phillauri – found the Punjabi actor to be an extremely quiet co-star, a trait that surprised her at first.
Talking to IndianExpress.com, Anushka said, “Diljit sits very quietly. He doesn’t talk much. I had seen his earlier films in which he is so funny and bubbly. But on the sets, he is very quiet and barely speaks. So, I was like, do you speak…aapne mooh se kabhi koi shabd nikala hai, sirjee.”
The actress, however, was all praises for Diljit’s work ethics and honesty. “He is a very honest actor. He himself says I am not an actor. I am singer. It’s just that I can act. But he does it because he has a honest quality within himself. So, when he is before the camera you can see that honesty and you can believe in him,” said Anushka.
The Sultan actress also expressed her admiration for Diljit for having made it big on his own merit. “He is a huge star in Punjab. People are crazy about him. He is huge both in Punjab and north India. And he has made it big on his own accord. Hats off to that.”
