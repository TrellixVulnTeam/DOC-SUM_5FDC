Retired Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete Caitlyn Jenner is reportedly set to pose naked for Sports Illustrated summer edition.
The “I Am Cait” star, 66, will grace the cover wearing “nothing but an American flag and her Olympic medal”, reported Ace Showbiz.
The picture will commemorate the 40th anniversary of her win at the Montreal games in 1976.


It will be the first time she poses with the medal since coming out as a transgender in April last year.
Jenner had said in August 2015 that while she called the medal her “most-prized possession,” she kept it hidden in her makeup drawer because she didn’t want her kids “to feel like they had to have a gold medal in order to be considered a success.”
