Actress Kareena Kapoor Khan, who is expecting her first child with actor Saif Ali Khan in December, wishes to work with her elder sister and star Karishma Kapoor.
Karishma, who has starred in popular films like “Hero No 1”, “Dil Toh Pagal Hai” and “Raja Hindustani”, was last seen onscreen in the 2013 film “Dangerous Isshq”.
Asked if she wishes or plans to star along with Karisma in a film, Kareena told IANS: “I always wish…there are no plans, but I wish to work with her (Karishma).”
Kareena says there aren’t any plans as she doesn’t know if the “Biwi No.1” star wants to come back on the silver screen.
“Right now there are no plans because I don’t know if she (Karisma) is even thinking of working on the big screen as her kids are really small…Her mindset is very different,” she said.
But the “Udta Punjab” actress stresses that if a good script comes their way, they might star together.
“But of course if there is a good script… You never know. But right now nothing,” she added.
Kareena is gearing up to start shooting for Rhea Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor’s upcoming venture “Veere Di Wedding”, which also stars Sonam Kapoor and Swara Bhaskar.
