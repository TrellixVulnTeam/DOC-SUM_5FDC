Salman's Sultan will break PK's record: Aamir ||||
 Praising the Salman Khan-starrer 'Sultan', actor Aamir Khan said, "If there is one film which can break the record of PK, it is Sultan. Notably, the Aamir Khan starrer 'PK', which released in 2014, became the first Bollywood film to cross the 300 crore-mark. Meanwhile, Salman's 'Sultan' has become the highest opening grosser of 2016, with collections of 36.54 crore. ||||

One of the highest grossing films of Bollywood is Aamir Khan’s PK, but the superstar feels if there is a movie which can break that record, it is Salman Khan’s Sultan.
The “Dhoom 3” star said the Ali Abbas Zafar-directed film, which released yesterday, ticks all the boxes of a good movie.
“I watched Sultan last evening. I found it very good. Ali Abbas Zafar has made a remarkable film. Be it the story, screenplay, dialogue, direction, all are good and every artist has done well,” Aamir told reporters here.
The 51-year-old actor said the film is an Eid’s gift from the “Dabangg” star.
“Everything is there what we expect from a mainstream film. I laughed, I cried and enjoyed a lot. It is an Eid gift from Salman. If there is one film which can break the record of ‘PK’, it is ‘Sultan’.”
Aamir watched the film with his “Dangal” co-stars and said he told Salman that he really liked the film.
“He wasn’t there but I was in touch with Salman throughout the film. He was happy that I liked it. It is an outstanding film. He has performed so well, done everything which we expect from a star and as well as a good artiste.”
When asked if it will be difficult for “Dangal” since “Sultan” has already set a benchmark, the actor said, “I never compare my films with others. Every film has its own story. I can only comment about how much I liked it… all films are different.”
“As far as Sultan goes, mujhe koi kami nazar nahi aayi (I did not find anything amiss). I cried, laughed, it is a very moving and inspiring film. No other words,” Aamir added.
