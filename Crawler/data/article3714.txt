AS MANY as 9.59 per cent of the newly-elected pradhans of 58,658 gram panchayats in Uttar Pradesh are illiterates, while 40.04 per cent of them have only studied up to Class V. This, according to figures released by the State Election Commission on Monday — a day after the poll results were declared.
The number of illiterate women pradhans is three times more than that of illiterate male pradhans. Nearly half of the total female pradhans elected, 49.28 per cent, have studied up to Class V. The figures indicate that more women would become ineligible if illiterates are barred or a minimum educational qualification is fixed for contesting panchayat polls as has been done in neighbouring Haryana.
On the other hand, while 5.02 per cent of the total male pradhans elected are illiterate, 32.81 per cent have studied till Class V.
According to figures, 43.86 per cent of all the pradhan posts were won by women — over 10 per cent more than their fixed quota of 33 per cent. Districts from where most women candidates won are Muslim-majority Sambhal(54.5 per cent), Rampur (54.4 per cent), Moradabad (51 per cent), Badaun (50.5 per cent) and Bahraich (49.6 per cent). The least number of women were elected as pradhans in Mathura (36.7 per cent), Agra (37 per cent) and Hathras (38 per cent).
Among the elected pradhans, 18 — including four women — are PhD holders. They include Tasleem Jamali (33), who has a PhD from Purvanchal University. She won from Visham Mirzapur in Azamgarh, the seat which was held by her husband Sarbat Alam. “Not only because the seat was reserved for women, I also wanted to do something for the village,” said Jamali, who is principal of a school in her village.
Manish Kumar Shukla (28), who won from Damarbhiswan gram panchayat in Deoria, has a PhD from Gorakhpur University. He is also a teacher by profession.
State Election Commissioner S K Agarwal said the Commission, for the first time, has provided the results for all gram panchayats online the same day the results were declared. “We used technology and made the process transparent. Candidates who had given their numbers, were sent an SMS about their elections’ result,” he added. The panchayat election process had started in 74 districts of the state in September with zila panchayat and kshetra panchayat elections.
“Though there were a few incidents of violence, such incidents were dealt with sternly and immediately, making the elections peaceful and successful. As many as 72 per cent votes were polled in gram panchayat polls,” said Agarwal.
