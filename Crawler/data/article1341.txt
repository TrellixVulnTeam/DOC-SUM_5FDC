Hyderabad, June 26 (PTI) Judges from Telangana and Andhra Pardesh today protested against non-withdrawal of the list of provisional allocation of judicial officers between both the states.
Over 100 judges, under the banner of the Telangana Judges Association, today organised a rally from Gun Park to Raj Bhavan here and submitted a representation to the governor, ESL Narasimhan against the provisional allocation of judicial officers.
Earlier, at a meeting here, around 125 judicial officers of Telangana also gave their resignations to the Telangana Judges Association president and authorised him to present them to Governor as and when he feels proper if their demands are not met, a representative of the Association told PTI.
"We will wait for one more week seeking fulfilment of our demands," he said.
Meanwhile, Telangana Advocates JAC co-convener T Sriranga Rao said, "Of the 21 judges at the Hyderabad High Court, 18 are natives of Andhra Pradesh and only three are from Telangana".
"The allocation was done by the High Court without taking into consideration the guidelines framed by the High Court in February this year.
"We have been seeking preparation of a fresh list of allocation between the two states as per the native district declared by the judicial officers at the time of entry into service by following the guidelines notified for bifurcation of lower judiciary, and as per Section 77 of the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014," Rao said.
