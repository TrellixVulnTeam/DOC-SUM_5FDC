Designer duo Asha and Gautam Gupta are organising Kargha, a Sari Festival, here from July 13 onwards.
Kargha (handloom) is a festival which exhibits their latest amalgamation with the Indian handloom weaves adopted from various parts of India – Patan, Uppada, Paithan and Banaras.
The latest collection, in colours like fuchsia, flamingo pink, blue and purple, has been designed by incorporating several art and crafts like Ikat, Batik, Patola and Paithani.

“It is our another endeavour to promote handloom. Collaborating with weavers from these new clusters will be a great journey for us,” Gautam said in a statement.
Asha shared that in the fast changing fashion, saris are one of the most elegant statements. “I don’t think it can ever be replaced,” she added.
The festival will conclude on July 18.
