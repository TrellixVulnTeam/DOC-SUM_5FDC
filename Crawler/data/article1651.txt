(Bloomberg) -- Revlon Inc., the makeup company controlled by billionaire Ron Perelman, will acquire Elizabeth Arden Inc. for $14 a share, a deal that values the perfume maker at about $870 million.
Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. have committed about $2.6 billion to help pay for the acquisition and refinance Elizabeth Arden’s debt, New York-based Revlon said in a statement on Thursday. The cash transaction represents a 50 percent premium over Elizabeth Arden’s closing price of $9.31.
“Revlon plans to build upon Elizabeth Arden’s ongoing transformation by further enhancing the brand,” Chief Executive Officer Fabian Garcia said in the statement. “Combining our brands, talent and global distribution will give our company a significant presence in all major channels and categories, while accelerating sales growth in existing and new geographic regions.”
