Srinagar, Jun 17 (PTI) Eighty four security camps and bunkers were removed in Jammu and Kashmir since January 2009 with the highest number of 22 such structures vacated in 2010--the year when the Valley witnessed a massive agitation leaving over 120 persons dead.
Most of the camps and bunkers were removed from summer capital Srinagar during the previous NC-Congress regime, while only six such structures were vacated since the PDP-BJP government came to power in the state, Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, who holds the Home Portfolio, said in a written reply in the Assembly here.
Replying to a question by opposition National Conference leader Omar Abdullah, the Chief Minister said a total of 258 camps and 18 bunkers were existing in the Valley as on January 1, 2009 - the year when Omar took over as the Chief Minister.
"The removal of remaining bunkers and camps of Army and central paramilitary forces will depend upon the review of security situation in consultation with all stakeholders, on case to case basis," Mehbooba said.
She said Srinagar accounted for the highest number of 117 camps and 11 bunkers followed by Sopore township of Baramulla district (35 camps), Kulgam (27 camps), Pulwama (23 camps, three bunkers), Budgam district (20 camps, one bunker), Anantnag (13 camps), Bandipora (eight camps, one bunker), Kupwara (five camps, two bunkers), Shopian (five camps), Baramulla (four camps) and Ganderbal (one camp).
Of these, 84 structures - 69 camps and 14 bunkers - were removed from towns and cities with effect from January 1, 2009, the Chief Minister said.
She said the highest number of 41 camps and 10 bunkers were removed from Srinagar followed by eight in Kulgam, seven camps in Sopore township, five camps each in Pulwama and Shopian districts, two camps and one bunker each from Bandipora and Kupwara districts.
