The NDA-led government on Wednesday blamed the previous UPA regime for the “decline” in financial condition of BSNL and MTNL, saying the two state-run telecom companies were together suffering losses to the tune of Rs 10,000 crore in 2014 when the BJP-led dispensation took over.
Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said in Lok Sabha that in 2004, BSNL was incurring profits of around Rs 10,000 crore and MTNL Rs 900 crore.
However, when the NDA government took charge in 2014, the BSNL was suffering a loss of Rs 8,000 crore and MTNL Rs 2,000 crore, he said replying to questions. “We are ready for a discussion in the House on the condition of both BSNL and MTNL and how their financial condition declined between 2004 and 2014,” he said.
Prasad also made it clear that as of now, the government has no plans to merge BSNL and MTNL and both the organisations were trying their best to generate maximum revenues for revival and revitalisation.
