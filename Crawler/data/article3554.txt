Singer-composer Bappi Lahiri says he will collaborate with American rapper and songwriter Akon in May next year.
“I recently recorded one song with Snoop Dogg, along with Tulsi Kumar for my forthcoming film. As far as Akon is concerned, I will be doing a song with him in Hollywood in the month of May and I am very excited about it,” Bappi told IANS.
“My song with Akon is again for my next film for which I am composing the music,” he added, without revealing the name of the film.
This won’t be Akon’s first association with Bollywood. He earlier did the “Chammak challo” for Shah Rukh Khan’s “Ra.One”.
