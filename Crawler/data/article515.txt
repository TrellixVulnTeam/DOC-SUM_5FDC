The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear a plea seeking the imposition of Governor’s rule in Jammu and Kashmir, under a provision of the Jammu & Kashmir Constitution. The hearing will be held next week.
The plea was filed by J&K Panther’s Party in light of the protests and violence that have taken over the state since the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander, Burhan Wani.
Clashes between security forces and protesters have resulted in the death of several civilians and CRPF officers.
Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti called an all-party meet to discuss the unrest in the Valley and asked the Centre to ensure engagement of all stakeholders in Jammu and Kashmir for carrying forward the peace and reconciliation process in the state.
The issue also came up for discussion in both Houses of Parliament following which Home Minister Rajnath Singh said the security forces will exercise restraint when it comes to civilians but maintained that there will be no place for militancy.
The Home Minister also agreed to set-up a committee that will look into other non-lethal weapons as the use of pellets by security forces had caused serious and in some cases permanent injuries to civilians. Some of those who were injured were as young as four-years-old.
Curfew is still on in the Valley as it enters its fourteenth day of protest.
