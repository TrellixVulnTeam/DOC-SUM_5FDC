Actor Aamir Khan is currently in the second phase of shooting for his upcoming movie Dangal in Ludhiana's Leel village.
As with all of Aamir's projects, this one too has generated a lot of interest among his fans and cinephiles. Dangal is a biopic on wrestler Mahavir Phogat, in which the 50-year-old actor essays the protagonist's role.
But just because the perfectionist actor is busy shooting, it doesn't mean other projects are on hold. Take for instance his popular reality TV show, Satyamev Jayate, for which the actor's team has already started work and research.
Indian Express recently caught up with him on the sets of Dangal, and when asked about the next season of 'Satyamev Jayate', he said, "Currently the entire team is working on a very crucial and ambitious project to deal with water crisis in Maharashtra. We are aiming to make Maharashtra drought free in coming years."
In the light of the water crisis in the state, this is a season many will be eagerly waiting for.
