Two workers belonging to the CPI (M) and BJP were killed in Keralaâ€™s Kannur district within the last 12 hours, indicating the return of violent politics to the sensitive region after a short lull.
Police said CPI (M) worker C V Danaraj, 36, was hacked to death by an unidentified gang in the courtyard of his house near Payyannur town around 10 pm Monday. He was about to enter the house, when a motorcyle-borne gang pounced over him. The gang, which arrived in three motorcyles, was following Danaraj on his way home. The victim died on the way to a hospital near Kannur. CPI (M) has blamed the BJP for the attack on its worker, a local leader.
Two hours later, BJP worker C K Ramachandran, 46, was murdered at his home near Payyannur. The assailants hurled a crude bomb, before hacking Ramachandran. He was declared dead upon arrival at the hospital. Ramachandran was the local leader of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), the labour wing of the RSS.
Tension has gripped the region once again after the two political murders. Reports indicated that houses of BJP and CPI (M) workers were attacked in the wake of the killings.
Post Assembly elections, there had been stray incidents of political murders in various parts of Kerala. With CPI (M) ruling Kerala and BJP at the Centre, the rivalry has intensified after elections.
