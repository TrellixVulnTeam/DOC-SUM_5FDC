Diego Maradona is offering to coach Argentina’s national team again – this time for free.
Argentina has been without a coach since Gerardo Martino stepped down following last month’s loss to Chile in the final of the Copa America.
Maradona previously coached Argentina from 2008 through to the 2010 World Cup, where the team reached the quarterfinals before losing 4-0 to Germany – a defeat that eventually cost him his job.
He says “If they said I could fix the team, I’d grab it and do it for nothing.”
Maradona has not been mentioned in a long list of coaches being talked about to replace Martino. They include Marcelo Bielsa, Miguel Angel Russo, Marcelo Gallardo, Jorge Burruchaga and Nery Pumpido.
