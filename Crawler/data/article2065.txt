Organise yagyas for rains. This was the suggestion offered on Wednesday by BJP member Virendra Singh to fellow Parliamentarians in the Lok Sabha as a means to mitigate the drought situation.
Participating in the debate on drought, water crisis and issues connected with inter-linking of rivers, Singh recalled the mythological story of Raja Janak ploughing the fields and organising yagya to please the rain Gods.
“Raja Janak’s rajdharma resulted in rains..Similarly, Modiji is trying to revive over seven lakh ponds to mitigate the problem of drought in the country,” Singh said.
“There are spiritual as well as scientific reasons for yagya. It helps in attracting clouds,” he argued.
Asking all MPs to organise yagya in their constituencies for rains, he said, “It will result in rains.”
According to him, droughts occur because people destroy nature in the name of development.
He also wanted the government and the state administration to appeal to the rich people to spend money for digging wells and ponds which could provide water in times of drought.
During his speech, he targeted the Uttar Pradesh government, saying its “indifferent attitude” was leading to worsening of drought situation in the state.
People are very angry and will give a befitting reply to the Chief Minister, the BJP MP said.
He asked the Centre government to take steps towards inter-linking of rivers saying it would be in the interest of the nation.
