Kangana Ranaut today expressed her desire to collaborate with Irrfan Khan regardless of the role offered to her. The actress, who was returning to Mumbai from Delhi, was quizzed at the airport about her thoughts on Irrfan's recent comment about the possibility of him working with her (Kangana) only if his role was that of "a heroine".
Reacting to the same, Kangana said, "He always teases me. He had once told me two swords could never stay in the same sheath. I couldn't understand it. But I would like to work with Irrfan sir regardless of whatever role is offered to me." (Read: Kangana Ranaut too big to act as Irrfan Khan’s heroine)
At the trailer launch of Madaari, when Irrfan was asked about losing a chance of working with Kangana in Sai Kabir's Divine Lover after the Queen actress dropped out of the movie, the actor had sarcastically remarked, "Kangana has gone so out of reach that I will work with her only if I wish to be a heroine. So, if a script comes along wherein she plays the hero and I the heroine, I will do it.”
Interestingly, one of the reasons given for Kangana's exit was her desire to do only solo lead films.
