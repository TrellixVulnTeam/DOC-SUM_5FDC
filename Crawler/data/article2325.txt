Alarmed at “deadly figures” due to drunken driving menace, the Centre has asked state governments not to give licences for liquor shops along the National Highways.
In India, around 1,18,840 road accidents have occurred in the last five years due to drunken driving.
“Chief Secretaries/Principal Secretaries/Secretaries (Transport) of all states/UTs have been requested to ensure that no licence is issued to liquor vendors along with National Highways,” Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari informed Rajya Sabha today.
Though licencing of liquor shops is covered under Excise Policy of the state and enforcement of various provisions of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 is responsibility of states, on account of “deadly figures due to drunken driving menace” the Centre has taken various steps, the minister said.
Inceptors with breath analysers have been provided by his Ministry to states to check cases of violations of traffic rules including drunken driving, he added.
Section 185 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 provides for punishment of imprisonment or fine or both for the offence of drunken driving.
