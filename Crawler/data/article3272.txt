TomTom Spark watches come with 3GB of music storage space and allow users to listen to music while running so they don’t have to carry their smartphones. The watches can connect with a variety of Bluetooth headphones and come pre-loaded with Running Trax, a thirty minute mix of motivating, high energy songs.
TomTom Spark watches with Cardio come with a built-in heart rate monitor that tracks heart rate, and all watches support a multi-sports tracking. The watches have a Gym, Running, Swimming, Cycling, Treadmill mode for training sessions. The Spark series has built-in 24×7 activity trackers as well to count the number of steps taken, calories burnt, sleep during the day, etc.
The new watches are also water resistant up to 40 metres. TomTom says the battery life is up to 3 weeks if used only for regular activity tracking. However if you use the watch for intense training sessions, it has a battery life of 11 hours, while the GPS Cardio and Music watch has a battery life of up to 5 hours.
“Our internal study revealed that over 75 per cent of people listen to music while they work out and many use a smartphone to do so. We have solved this uncomfortable problem with the integrated music player in the TomTom Spark,” said Peter Frans, co-founder of TomTom International on the launch.
On the growing competition in the fitness wearable space and the rise of more ‘prettier’ fitness bands in recent times, Frans said that unlike others TomTom offers a clear purpose, which helps them stand out.
“I think we’re in a good space with our fitness watch.  It is a product with a clear purpose, it is built for workouts. If you’re going to be active, then this is a good product. Of course, in general what we’re seeing is more sensors are coming into the market built into the devices, dealing with more data and analytics. We’re doing a lot of innovations there, especially in our app,” said the TomTom co-founder.
“For instance our app MySports also links to Apple’s HealthKit, to Android Wear. We also link to Strava as a lot of people who cycle use that app, we link to RunKeeper, etc. We have a completely open approach to that. But what’ve seen is that most people who buy the product, they loved the MySports app too,” he added.
TomTom’s India Country Sales Manager Hitesh Ahuja stressed that the high-prices of the watches had not proved to be a problem for the company in India.
“When we launched our watches in 2015, we were looking at India from a different angle. We thought India is going to be very price-sensitive market, but we’ve been proved wrong. Our top-end watches with heart-rate sensors contributes more than 50 per cent to our sales. It shows the rising trend for fitness gadgets in India,” said Hitesh Ahuja, Country Sales Manager, TomTom India.
