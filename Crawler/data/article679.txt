Mumbai, Jul 16 (PTI) Superstar Salman Khan says he advised actor-friend Aamir Khan to not go for six-pack abs look in "Dangal", where the latter plays the role of real-life wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat.
The poster of "Dangal" is out and it features Aamir sitting with his on-screen daughters, whom he trains in wrestling.
"I have seen it (poster)... Its very nice. Wait for the poster in which he (Aamir) comes bare-chested. I gave him advice don't make six-pack abs as it's the role of a wrestler. He (Aamir) said Sushil Kumar (real life wrestler) and all have made it, but I told him 'you don't do it'," Salman said in an interview.
Recently, during the poster launch of "Dangal" the 51-year-old actor had said that he is releasing the poster of his film with Salman's "Sultan" so that it attracts more eyeballs.
On Aamir's strategy Salman said, "Everyone was aware of 'Dangal' much before 'Sultan'".
The "PK" actor had also said that the "Bajrangi Bhaijaan" actor is a bigger star than him.
To this, Salman, 50, replied with a chuckle, "He doesn't lie."
Aamir recently saw "Sultan" and was all praise for it.
