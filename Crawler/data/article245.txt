Paparazzi is a fraternity Katrina Kaif has never really shared a great relationship with. The actress doesn't like being 'spotted and clicked' by the paps and had once vented her ire on photojournalists for clicking her while she was home hunting with celeb manager Reshma Shetty after her alleged break-up with Ranbir Kapoor.
Katrina had then lashed out at photojournalists and threatened to file a police complaint against them for clicking her unannounced. A repeat of the same happened yesterday evening when Katrina stepped out of choreographer Ganesh Acharya's studio after a dance rehearsal.
Apparently, Katrina who was rehearsing for her upcoming world tour was not feeling too well and a doctor had been called in to check on her. Soon enough, the Fitoor actress packed up and left. While entering the car outside the studio, a few photographers present clicked Katrina while she was entering her car. This upset the actress so much so that she stepped out and gave the photogs a piece of her mind.
Informs a source, "Katrina looked angry and let the photographers know about it in no uncertain terms. I will file a complaint, she threatened before leaving."
It's no secret that Katrina doesn't like being followed and clicked anywhere. On her birthday on July 16, when Katrina on realising that her car is being tailed by photogs stepped out of her car and posed for photos and later requested to not follow her for anymore pictures.
