BJP MP Vijay Goel Friday claimed that a survey of 4,700 respondents showed that the second round of the AAP government’s odd-even scheme had “failed” in Delhi. The BJP leader said the scheme had increased the number of cars per household and it was going to worsen traffic congestion on the capital’s roads.
“People have been cheated in both phases of the scheme. In the first phase of odd-even, schools were shut and there were many public holidays. Similarly, if one takes into account the weekends and other holidays, then government offices, most businesses and the major markets of the city were closed for six days in the second phase. Despite this, people have rejected the scheme,” said Goel.
According to Goel, respondents of the survey said the government implemented the second phase without proper planning or adequate public transport.

People were forced to travel in overcrowded buses and Metro trains during the second phase of the scheme, said the BJP MP, adding that if the next round of the road-rationing exercise was implemented with such “poor planning”, it would be “aggressively opposed” by the people.
Goel said the current phase of odd-even had seen “the registration of more CNG cars, expenditure of crores of rupees on self-publicity, increase in sale of scooters which were most polluting, exploitation by Uber and Ola and parents finding it difficult to drop their children to school”.
“All agencies, including the CPCB, show that pollution has increased during this period, the Delhi government is busy blaming others, people are afraid of paying a fine of Rs 2,000 and they say that public transport, especially the number of buses, has not increased,” said Goel.
The BJP MP claimed that 68 per cent of people surveyed said the scheme had “failed” in its second phase.
Goel attributed the reduction in traffic congestion at some traffic points to festivals that fell during this period.
