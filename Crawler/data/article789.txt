Indian Air Force Wing Commander Pooja Thakur on Thursday moved Armed Forces Tribunal after being denied permanent commission in IAF.
“Armed Forces Tribunal admitted the matter and has sought IAF’s response within four weeks,” Thakur’s lawyer Sudhanshu Pandey told ANI news.
Thakur, who joined the Indian Air Force in 2000, belongs to the administrative branch and is currently posted at ‘Disha’, the publicity cell under the Directorate of Personnel Officers at the Air Force Headquarters.
Thakur rose to fame as she led an Inter-Service Guard of Honour last year when President Obama visited India in January.
Obama had later said the sight of “incredible” Indian women in the armed forces was one of his “favourite things” in
India.
Thakur had then said, “It feels good that we have been able to achieve our aim of giving him a befitting Guard of
Honour. I am glad that he has appreciated.”
The defence forces, in a first, had chosen women officers to lead their marching contingents during the Republic Day
parade last year.
As part of her duty, she was involved with the initiation and development of the IAF mobile game “Guardians of the Sky” which was visualised as a new and innovative step to reach the mobile-friendly tech-savvy students.
