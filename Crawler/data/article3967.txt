DJI launched its first agricultural drone, Agras MG-1 capable of crop-dusting over seven-10 acres per hour. It features Intelligent Flight Modes and will initially be only available in China.
The company says that the drone is dust-proof, water-resistant and made of anti-corrosive material. It can also be folded up for easy transport and storage. Agras MG-1 can fly at up to eight meters per second with more than 10 kgs of liquid for spraying crops. It is smart and can adjust its spraying speed to flying speed.
“With this new product, we’ve shown that DJI can not only offer the ultimate aerial experience for the mass consumer, but also improve the efficiency of production and benefit so many others in all walks of life,” said DJI CEO and founder Frank Wang.
The eight-rotor drone comes with select automatic, semi-automatic and manual operation modes and can prove to be 40 times more efficient than manual spraying. It can automatically maintain its height and distance from plants.
DJI has also brought its Lighbridge 2 transmission system to Agras MG-1. It has centrifugal cooling system and the triple-filtration feature cuts off the intake of mist, dust and large particulates.
Agras MG-1 comes with an intelligent memory function, which allows the drone to return to its last memory point. Users can control the drone with a custom DJI remote.
