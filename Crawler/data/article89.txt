Rajnath's speech at SAARC conference blacked out ||||
 Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singhs address at SAARC summit in Islamabad was reportedly completely blacked out by Pakistan on Thursday. The 'only' broadcaster allowed inside to cover the conference at the venue was state-run Pakistan Television (PTV). Criticising the move, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu said, "This is Pakistan's model of democracy. Parliament is in session, we will respond there." ||||

India on Thursday described the reports of a ‘blackout’ of Home Minister Rajnath Singh’s statement during the SAARC ministerial meeting as “misleading”.
“With reference to the Home Ministers meeting in Islamabad earlier today, media reports of a ‘blackout’ of our Home Minister’s statement are misleading.”
“It is the standard SAARC practice that the opening statement by the host country is public and open to the media while the rest of the proceedings are in camera, which allows for a full and frank discussion of issues,” a government source said.
The reaction came after there were reports that Rajnath Singh’s speech was reportedly blacked out as media organisations were not allowed to cover the 7th SAARC Home/Interior Ministers’ conference.
The only broadcaster allowed inside the venue was state-owned Pakistan Television, the reports said.
