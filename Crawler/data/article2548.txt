The film is an amalgamation of six stories by six directors from around the world (Anurag being one of them) who tell six different stories about love. The directors are from America, Australia, Argentina, Japan, UK and India. These short films which look at the idea of modern day love, have been tied together to make one feature film.
This is the film from which the nude clip featuring Radhika had leaked online and went on to create controversy.
Radhika’s wall is full of of praises as she has brought international glory to the nation by winning this award.
Arjun Kapoor, Vicky Kaushal, Hansal Mehta wished the actress on her big win.
