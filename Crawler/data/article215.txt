New Delhi, Jul 30 (ANI): Not so long ago, Shah Rukh Khan took everyone's breath away when snaps of his newly-attained 8-pack abs for 'Happy New Year' hit the Internet. It turns out, he owes it all to Hrithik Roshan.
While the Greek God, as he is sometimes called, makes many women go weak in the knees with his toned physique, his workout routine has inspired many men within Bollywood and outside to hit the gym.
When King Khan recently went live on fame, he revealed interesting things about his fitness regimes, especially the one where he took a leaf out of the 42-year-old actor's book.
The 50-year-old 'Fan' actor, who was all praise for his 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' co-star's chiseled body, said, "I used to work out seeing Hrithik Roshan's picture in my gym. This was nearly twenty years ago. We had a picture of Hrithik standing pulling over his suspenders, this was from Dabboo Ratnani's shoot. We used to keep his picture."
On the work front, Hrithik is currently juggling between the promotions of Ashutosh Gowariker's period drama 'Mohenjo Daro,' which will hit the theatres on August 12, and shooting of his upcoming film, 'Kaabil,' while SRK is going to have as many as three releases in 2017 - 'Raees,' Imtiaz Ali's next film starring Aunshka Sharma and Aanand L Rai's next movie.
