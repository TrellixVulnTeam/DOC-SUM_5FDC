The National Congress Party (NCP) on Sunday took a jibe at Smriti Irani over her exclusion from the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs (CCPA) and said it clearly indicates the fact that bad days have begun for her.
NCP’s Tariq Anwar said the latest development in this regard is indicative of the fact that Prime Minister Modi is upset with Irani.
“I would just say that the bad days have begun for Smriti Irani. The manner in which one after the other incident is taking place with her, this clearly states that somewhere Prime Minister is upset with Smriti Irani,” Anwar told reporters.

In the recent Cabinet reshuffle, Irani was shifted from the HRD ministry to textiles.
Ahead of the Monsoon Session of Parliament beginning on Monday, Prime Minister Modi-led government has rejigged the CCPA. Irani has been dropped from the CCPA as a special invitee and her successor in the HRD Ministry Prakash Javadekar elevated as a member along with the newly-appointed Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar.
In the recent cabinet reshuffle earlier this month, Irani was shifted from HRD to Textile Ministry.
