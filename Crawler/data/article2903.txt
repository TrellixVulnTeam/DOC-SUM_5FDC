A 28-year-old PhD scholar from the University of Hyderabad, Ditty Suresh, who was reportedly suffering from depression, went missing from the university’s health centre on Saturday. Suresh had reportedly been suffering from depression for several months and had been seeing a psychiatrist arranged by the university.
His depression apparently became worse after Dalit research scholar Rohith Vemula’s suicide. He recently posted on his Facebook in Malayalam: “There is little time left in my journey.” When his colleagues asked him about it, he merely said it was the truth. Suresh is a member of the Ambedkar Students Association, which Rohith was associated with. He had also written glowing tributes about Rohith on his Facebook page.
Dr Ravindra Kumar, head of the University Health Centre, said they had taken a decision to admit Suresh to a private hospital for psychiatric treatment and had summoned his father from Trivandrum. “His father arrived today and we were supposed to send him to the hospital but he went missing,” Dr Kumar said. Suresh’s motorcycle is also missing.
His father, Suresh Joseph, lodged a complaint with Gachibowli Police Station. Suresh is in the third year of Phd and lives in room No. 25 of K hostel.
