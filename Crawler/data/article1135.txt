The actor took to social media to express his condolences to the victims. He also lashed out at the terrorists for bringing a bad name to Islam by carrying out such activities and questioned the silence of the Muslim community.
“Quran ki aayeten naa janne ki wajeh se ramzaan ke mahine mein logon ko qatal ker diya gaya. Haadsa ek jagah hota hai , badnaam Islaam aur poori duniya ka musalman hota hai,” Irrfan mentioned on his post.
