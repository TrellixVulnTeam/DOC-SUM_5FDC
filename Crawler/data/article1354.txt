Kathmandu, Jun 26 (PTI) Over 8,000 boundary pillars along the Indo-Nepal border will be equipped with positioning system using Global Navigation Satellite System, allowing authorities for the first time to effectively manage the more than 1,700-km-long porous boundary.
Nepal's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the Nepal�India Boundary Global Navigation Satellite System (NIB GNSS) would be used for Nepal�India boundary pillars.
The decision in this regard was made at the third meeting of Nepal�India Boundary Working Group (BWG) which concluded here yesterday, a statement from the ministry said.
Krishna Raj BC, Director General of the Survey Department, led the Nepali delegation during the three-day meeting while the Indian delegation was led by Swarna Subba Rao, Surveyor General of India.
"The BWG meeting reviewed reports submitted before it by the SOC meetings and Joint Field Survey Teams (FST) and appreciated the progress made on the ongoing boundary works carried out at Nepal�India border," the statement said.
The officials decided that the completion of the "backlogged tasks from previous field seasons" will be given high priority, The Himalayan Times reported quoting the statement.
"Both the delegations reaffirmed the importance of effective boundary management. In this context, they emphasised the importance of making local authorities and people living along the border aware of the field works being conducted by joint field teams," it said.
Before the BWG meeting, the fourth meeting of Survey Officials' Committee (SOC) was held here from 20 to 22 June.
