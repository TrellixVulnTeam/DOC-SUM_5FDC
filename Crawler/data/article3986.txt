“Fast and Furious” star Paul Walker’s father has filed a lawsuit against car company Porsche, alleging wrongful death of his son.
In the court documents obtained, the actor’s father, who is the executor of Walker’s estate, alleges the Porsche Carrera GT lacked certain safety features that could have saved the lives of Walker and his friend, Roger Rodas, who was driving at the time of the accident, reported People magazine.
Similar to the wrongful death lawsuit the actor’s daughter Meadow brought against the car company, Walker’s father states that the missing features include a stability control system, side-door reinforcements and a breakaway fuel line that could have stopped the car from catching on fire after it hit three trees.
Police determined the cause of the fatal accident to be speeding, stating that the driver had been going between 80 and 90 MPH at the time of impact.
Despite the official investigation, the new lawsuit states, “absent these defects in the Porsche Carrera GT, Paul Walker would be alive today.”
While Porsche is yet to respond to this lawsuit, it replied to Meadow’s allegation saying, Walker was responsible for his own death.
