The Supreme Court on Monday rejected the plea of activist Harish Mander challenging exoneration of BJP President Amit Shah in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh ‘fake encounter case’.  Lawyer Kapil Sibal was fighting the case on behalf of Mander along with Rajeev Dhavan and Anand Grover.
The court rejected Sibal’s argument that Mander could challenge Shah’s exoneration on the grounds that he was a ‘person aggrieved’. Harish Salve was arguing for Amit Shah in the case.
The Mumbai Sessions court had given a clean chit to Amit Shah in the case on December, 30 2014. Harish Mander filed the petition in Supreme Court seeking a quashing of the sessions court order.
