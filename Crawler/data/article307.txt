The poster of Bollywood actor Ajay Devgn’s magnum opus “Sons Of Sardaar” has been unveiled.
The 47-year-old actor said the movie is a tribute to the warriors of Battle of Saragarhi.
“Unveiling @SonsOfSardaar My tribute to Warriors of Saragarhi: A tale of Rage, of Love, of Bravery. #SonsOfSardaar,” Devgn posted.
“Sons of Sardaar” will tell the story of the 21 Sikhs who fought to death in the 1897 Battle of Saragarhi.
Details about the film are yet unknown.
Devgn is currently busy with his directorial venture “Shivaay”, which is slated to release this Diwali.
Ajay Devgn has credited his upcoming film Shivaay for taking him to breathtaking locations.
Shivaay was shot at scenic locales of the Balkan mountains of Bulgaria, besides in Hyderabad and Uttarakhand.
In the first poster, Ajay can be seen hanging down, and seems to be attacking a monster which appears to be made of ice, while another demon glares at him from behind.
It’s not only about fantasy, but also gives a modern twist. One can see a helicopter in the backdrop. Along with the icy effect, one can also see fire raging behind – a result of a bomb blast perhaps.
By the look of it, the film promises bundle of action sequences, scenic backdrops, and an intriguing storyline.
Shivaay also stars debutants Sayyeshaa, the grandniece of veteran Bollywood actress Saira Banu, Erika Kaar and British Child actor Abigail Eames.
