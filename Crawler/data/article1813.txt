New Delhi, May 22 (PTI) Delhi's list of top 10 wanted criminals will be extended to over 20 and former Mundka MLA Rambir Shokeen is one of them.
Shokeen, who carries a reward of Rs 1 lakh on his arrest, was charge-sheeted last year under provisions of Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) for his alleged involvement in a crime syndicate headed by his nephew Neeraj Bawana, who has been arrested.
Considering the city's high crime rate and the involvement of these wanted criminals and their associates in cases of contract killings, extortion, etc, the 'Compendium of Top Criminals in Delhi' is being re-published in less than two months of publication of the previous one.
The Crime Branch has been entrusted with preparing the compendium. While Shokeen's name was among a few added by Crime Branch, the others were recommended for incorporation by the district Deputy Commissioners of Police, a senior official said.
"It was also necessary to re-publish the compendium because a few of the criminals listed in the previous one have been arrested. While the last one had a list of top 10 criminals, it shall be extended to 22-25 in the new one," he said.
The other most wanted include -- Tilu of outer Delhi, wanted in several cases including the murder of a police official in Alipur, Manjit Mahal, Shakti, Nafe Mantri and Ravinder Bholu, all key members of notorious gangs in southwest Delhi, and Hemant Pradhan, wanted for former MLA Bharat Singh's murder.
