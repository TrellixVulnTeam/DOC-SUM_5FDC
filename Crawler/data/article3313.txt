Addressing the National Youth Festival via video conference, Modi invoked Swami Vivekananda's teachings and urged the youth to "preserve our diverse culture" so that "hundreds of languages and different religions...can live in peace." ||||

Harmony, peace and unity between people is the first requirement for development, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday. Using the words “sadbhav” (harmony) and “sadbhavna” (goodwill) several times in his address, made via video-conference at the inaugural ceremony of the 20th National Youth Festival, Modi said the country needs three things — “hunar (skill), vikas (development), and sadbhav (harmony)” — to work in unison so it can progress.
In a speech that lasted a little over half an hour, Modi said, “I see youngsters sitting before me who come from different backgrounds, different parts of the country, who look different, who speak different languages, behave differently. If we don’t have goodwill for each other, then is it possible for us to sit together like this? Three things are required for India to go forward — skill, development and harmony… If there is no unity, no tolerance, no goodwill for everyone around you, if we have no respect for their views, there will be an obstruction to development… Peace and harmony is a guarantee for progress.”
Speaking to a crowd largely comprising young performers, he said the country has innumerable differences, but people have always lived together in peace. “From the Vedas to Vivekananda, we have always learnt this. We will have to keep stressing on this. We have to protect it,” he said.

“Where Naxalism tries to mislead the youth, skill development is taking place, giving people hope,” Modi added.
Referring to Maoists, he said, “Haath hatya ke liye nahi, hunar ke liye hone chahiye (hands should not be for killing but for honing skill).”
Pitching the ‘Start-up India, Stand up India’ programme, set to launch on January 16, Modi said that India was a storehouse of talent.
The Prime Minister also said Indians have created “an unfortunate state of mind that people who work with their minds are more worthy of praise than those that work with their hands”.
“We think that those who work with their hands are not worthy of our respect. I think back to our mothers. Some worked with their minds, but a large majority worked hard with their hands to bring us up. A babu looks big, a plumber looks small. We must start by empathy, by believing we are equal. To that effort, we have started Shramdev Jayate, which ensures dignity of labour,” Modi said.
