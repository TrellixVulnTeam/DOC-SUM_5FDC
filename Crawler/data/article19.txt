India were up against world champions Russia in the quarters and the trio of  Laxmirani Majhi, Bombayla Laishram, Deepika Kumari did well to test the formidable unit and take them to shootoff but they would have been disappointed with the result since they were two sets up after the end of the first three sets. Russia showed why they are the world champs as they not only sealed the fourth set, but also the shootoff to book a semi-final spot. There is some scope of improvement for the Russian unit as the competition only gets tougher in the medal rounds ahead. In their next match, they take on Italy in the second semi-final. Earlier, India women’s team faced tough opposition from Colombia in the pre-quarters round of the women’s recurve archery event but eventually came out on top to set up a quarterfinal contest with Russia. The final scoreline read 5-3 in India’s favour with the contest coming down to the final set and even the last two arrows.
