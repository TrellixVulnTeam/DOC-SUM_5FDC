Designer Anita Dongre in partnership with the government, will be launching handloom clusters across India soon. The designer, who met Union Textiles Minister Smriti Irani on Thursday, says she is looking forward to work with the government.
“The meeting went very well. We are looking forward to start the work from next week where we partner with the government on working with some handloom clusters,” Dongre told IANS. Dongre in association with BJP’s parliament member Poonam Mahajan has been working towards elevating and providing sustained employment to Charoti village on the outskirts of Mumbai. And she says they plan to launch clusters on the same line soon.
“We have had a very successful project at Charoti. We pulled it out successfully and we hope to repeat the Charoti format with handloom clusters,” said Dongre, who is participating in the ongoing Vogue Wedding Show 2016. She added that the locations will be finalised next week.
“We are looking at starting with at least four clusters and we will identify them by next week. We will definitely take one cluster to the northeast,” she said.
