Prisma, is a new app, which will make your Instagram filters passé. The app has been launched exclusively on iOS. Prisma lets you convert your pictures into works of art, following the styles of Van Gogh, Picasso, Levitan, according to the company’s website.
Prisma relies on neural networks and artificial intelligence in order to turn your photos into art, and the iOS-only app has taken the Internet by storm. For smartphone users, this is the hot new trend that has gone viral and needs to be tried out.
The app’s concept is pretty simple: You upload a picture from the Camera roll or take one, then just tap next and start choosing the filter that appeals most to you. The filters have names like Impression, Curtain, Running in the storm, Mondrian, etc and you can choose to define the intensity of a filter that you apply.
The app takes a couple of seconds to apply the filter, but the wait is worth it as some of these deliver stunning results. Prisma lets users directly share on Instagram and Facebook, which might appeal to many, given that this is why most of us spend hours editing photos.
Prisma app has been developed by Prisma Labs, and the company plans to launch video-editing as well.
For iOS  users, who love to edit their photos, Prisma is a new must-have app.
