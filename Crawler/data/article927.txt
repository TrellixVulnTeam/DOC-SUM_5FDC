Blaming the Centre for deepening agricultural crisis in the Punjab, the Agricultural Minister Tota Singh Saturday accused the NDA government of ignoring the state.
Singh while addressing the farmers from Punjab and Haryana during a conference on ‘organic farming’, organised by the Sarbat Da Bhala Trust and Punjab Jagriti Manch, said, “We increased the land under maize crop, but we did not get the Minimum Support Price (MSP) required for it, the Centre then urged us to bring more area under pluses (Mung Dal) cultivation but at the same time they imported pluses from foreign countries which decreased the price of daal. Centre must change its mentality towards Punjab,” he said.

Speaking to the media persons on the sidelines of the event, he slammed the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) which is a part of NDA government, for not presenting the case of the farmers properly. “The state government is lacking resource to bail out farmers from the crisis. Only electricity is being provided to farmers free of cost,” he said, adding that if the Centre gives two MSPs - one for organic and other for in-organic farming then people will come on their own.
Several farmers from Punjab and Haryana attended this programme in which over a dozen were honoured for doing successful organic farming.
