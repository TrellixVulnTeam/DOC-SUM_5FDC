New Delhi, May 22 (PTI) The JD(U) today opposed the appointment of Kiran Bedi as Puducherry Lt Governor, alleging such 'political' appointments are made to serve interests of the ruling party.
"Kiran Bedi's appointment is a political appointment. She had fought last Delhi elections as CM candidate of BJP. Such political appointments are made to serve the interest of the ruling party. They are first appointed and then misused. Even during Congress time in past political appointments were made.
"Then we and BJP used to oppose it together. Now these appointments are being made by the BJP as well, when it has become the ruling party," said party general secretary K C Tyagi.
