In the shootoff, Russia were off the blocks with a 10 and India could only manage seven with the first arrow. Some relief came India’s way after Russia scored only six from the second arrow. Majhi had to fire a at least a nine to make most of the error but she could only score 8.

Russia’s third arrow was a brilliant nine and India needed a 10, very close to the centre, to book a semis berth. Deepika failed to do so and Russia were through to the semis with a thrilling 5-4 win over India on Sunday.
