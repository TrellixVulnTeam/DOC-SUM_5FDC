Madrid, Jun 24 (PTI) Actress Freida Pinto today refused to be drawn into the issue of Salman Khan's controversial rape analogy but said one should be strong enough to say sorry when wrong.
Salman has been widely slammed for comparing the gruelling shoot for his upcoming film "Sultan" to feeling like a raped woman and while his father Salim Khan has apologised, the actor recently quipped that the less he spoke, the better it is.
Bollywood has largely been silent on the issue except for Kangana Ranaut, Anurag Kashyap and singer Sona Mohapatra criticising the superstar.
When asked to respond on the controversy, Pinto, who made her debut at IIFA here, said sometimes what is said might not be "negative but it may be unconventional".
"It's very important to be responsible in what you say. I think it's also so important that it can feel like a burden because there are times when you want to say," she told PTI on the sidelines of the IIFA.
"And I am not talking about this person. I am just talking about people in general... You might want to say something and it might not be negative, it may be unconventional. But then that responsibility also comes with consequences so you have to be strong enough and bold enough to say I am sorry when you are wrong and stand by your words when you are right. I feel like there is a lot of responsibility," she added.
