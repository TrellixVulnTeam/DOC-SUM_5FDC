Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi has asked the law ministry to enact a law for mandatory registration of sex offenders who have served their punishment so as to allow surveillance by local police.
The letter, written to Law minister D V Sadanand Gowda, comes ahead of the release of the juvenile in the Delhi gangrape case this month. Maneka said that registered sex offenders should be made to appear before law enforcing agencies in person from time to time and furnish details of their home and workplace. She added that the courts can decide the duration for such monitoring depending on the gravity of the offence and whether the accused is a repeat offender.
“In cases where the accused are convicted for committing heinous crimes, the orders of the court may also include mandatory requirement of registration of the accused in local police station so that police can monitor their activities and keep track of their movements,” the letter said.
