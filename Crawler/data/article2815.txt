On Thursday, Headley had testified before the court that Ishrat Jahan, a 19-year-old girl from Mumbra near Mumbai, was killed in an unsuccessful Lashkar-e-Toiba operation in Gujarat. Ishrat, who was killed in an alleged fake encounter in Gujarat in 2004, was claimed to have been in an operation along with her associates to kill then chief minister Narendra Modi. Headley’s statement, which he had made earlier in 2010 before the FBI and NIA, created ripples within the BJP and the Congress.
