Ever since the first trailer of Quantico landed all those months ago, we have not heard the end of jokes/memes/comments about Priyanka Chopra’s accent. Priyanka went from being a newbie in American television to the star of ABC to landing her debut in Hollywood in Baywatch to an international star but the jokes about her American accent refused to go away. AIB’s Tanmay Bhat realised on Thursday night that while Priyanka is ready to take this joke on her chin, her fans are not so accommodating.
So, when Tanmay took a dig at her on Thursday, he had to face the ire of her fans. “When I say @priyankachopra’s name in my head I now automatically pronounce it like ‘Priyaaaanka Chopruh’,” he wrote. Priyanka, who has proved in the past that her sense of humour is rather vibrant was quick to respond, “I’m supposed to have the accent @thetanmay what happened to u? Lol.”

While this good-natured back and forth was going on, some serious trolling began and the target, of course, was Tanmay. “PC fans, kyu mujhpe chadh rahe ho, it was meant to be a compliment what is wrong with some of you smh,” the stand-up comedian wrote.

Quantico’s Alex Parrish had to step in before things went out of hand. “Guys it was a joke!! From me and him!! Comedy is the smartest form of entertainment!and @thetanmay has it down!xoxo,” Priyanka tweeted. Only if Lata Mangeshkar and Sachin Tendulkar could have done that. Right, Tanmay Bhat?
