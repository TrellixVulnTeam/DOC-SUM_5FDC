LG not bound by Delhi govt's advice: Delhi HC ||||
 The Delhi High Court on Thursday dismissed the AAP government's contention that the Lieutenant Governor (LG) is bound to act on the advice of the Council of Ministers as "without any substance". The court held that the LG is the administrative head of the National Capital Territory, as Article 239 remains in force in Delhi, making it a Union Territory. ||||

The Delhi High Court on Thursday passed its judgement against the AAP government and favoured Najeeb Jung saying that the L-G is the administrative head of the National Capital and not the Chief Minister Arvind kejriwal. It’s a major setback for the AAP government.
The court said, “L-G is not bound to act as per advise of Delhi Cabinet”. The High court also said that “AAP Government’s contention that L-G is bound to act on advice of Council of Ministers is without any substance and cannot be accepted”.
The bench, comprising Chief justice G Rohini and Justice Jayant Nath ruled that decisions taken by the Delhi government without consulting the LG were illegal.The court further said that the ACB cannot take any action against central government officials. The AAP government’s counsel said they will file an appeal against the order immediately.
The court in its judgement said that Article 239 continues to remain applicable that makes Delhi a Union territory.
The court cited a commission of inquiry into the transport scam (dt 11/8/15) was illegal as L-G Najeeb Jung’s permission was not taken. The Delhi High Court further said that the appointment of a commission of inquiry into DDCA  as well as the appointment of persons to the board of BSES, without the L-G’s permission, were illegal.

In its order, the court also said that policy directions cannot be issued without consulting with the L-G. The court, however, maintained that though the L-G is competent to appoint special public prosecutors, the power has to be exercised on aid and advice of the council of ministers.
