Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag has appealed to the jats to end their violent agitation for reservation, saying that people of the community are saviours and not destroyers.
“I appeal to all my brothers to give up violence and present their demands in a constitutional manner. We are saviours, not destroyers,” Sehwag, who is himself a jat, tweeted.
 
 
“We have made the country proud whether in the army or in sports, our zeal should be used to do good for the country,” he added.
 
 
Jats are demanding reservation and despite various leaders, including the Haryana Chief Minister M L Khattar, appealing to them to maintain peace, there was no let up in the protests which have disrupted normal life in Rohtak, Jind, Bhiwani, Jhajjar, Sonipat and Hisar.
Yuvraj Singh echoed Sehwag’s words in asking for calm.
Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin also chimed in on the issue and asked for dialogue from the people involved rather than resorting to vandalism.
 
Boxer Vijender Singh too urged the Jats to keep calm and appealed for peace.
