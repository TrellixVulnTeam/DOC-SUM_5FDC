The Valsad district administration initiated an inquiry Friday after urea balls were reportedly found in rice bags meant for midday meals. When the cooking staff of a school in Hunda village in Valsad discovered this, they reported it to the authorities. Sources said that the incident took place on Thursday afternoon, when the midday meal cooking staff at Ambabari primary school in Hunda village, Kaprada taluka, found small white balls in the rice bag and reported it to the principal, Hansa Patel.

The school principal took a sample to Taluka Education officer I S Patel, who later contacted the deputy mamlatdar of midday meals, Sandeep Desai. Desai and his team took statements from the midday meal staff, along with the school principal, and started a probe. During the interaction with the school staffers, Desai learnt that they had bought three gunny bags of rice from a fair price shop in the neighbouring Barjupada village. The other two bags, however, did not have the “urea”.
The team went to Barjupada village Friday and checked the stock in the shop owned by Nilesh Raut, and found his stock to be unadulterated. Sandeep Desai said, “The samples collected from the gunny bags have been for tests. At present, it seems that the white balls are urea fertilizer.”
