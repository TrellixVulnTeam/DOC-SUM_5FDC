The Supreme Court Monday reproached the Delhi government for “wanting everything on platter” in matters of governance, and questioned why its ministers were sitting in air-conditioned chambers instead of talking to Haryana government for resumption of water supply to Delhi that had been affected due to Jat quota stir.
“You rest in AC chambers and you want orders from the court…You people instead of solving the problem at government-to-government level are moving the Supreme Court… You want everything on a platter,” observed the bench led by Chief Justice of India T S Thakur.
The bench took strong exception to the presence of Delhi Water Minister Kapil Mishra in the courtroom during the hearing and the fact that there was no positive statement by the government counsel on whether there was any communication with Haryana over the issue.

“If there is no water, what is he (Minister) doing here? He has to be with other ministers… talking to officials of the other state… army has been called in. All that is possible is being done by Haryana government. But what is he (Mishra) doing here? This is a matter of governance. Are you saying that the government has done nothing?,” the bench asked the Delhi government’s counsel.
It added, “You ministers are sitting in court instead of going to the field.”
However, senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for the Delhi government, pleaded the court to acknowledge the urgency of the matter and the problems that the Delhi residents will be compelled to undergo in case the water supply is not restored.
Upon Dhavan’s repeated requests based on public interest, the bench asked the Haryana government to make the necessary arrangement for resumption of water supply in the capital, and sought a status report in two days.
On his part, the counsel appearing for Haryana government, informed the bench that they were trying to ensure that water supply is resumed immediately.
The bench also issued notice to the Centre and Uttar Pradesh government over the Delhi government’s plea.
The government had filed a plea seeking directions to the Centre and Haryana government to restore water supply, which has been disrupted by the Jat protests.
While issuing notices, the bench clarified, “We are concerned for the people. We believe this (agitation) is going settle down soon.”
