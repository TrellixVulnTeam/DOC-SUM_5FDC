Amit Doda, the nephew of liquor baron and SAD leader Shiv Lal Doda, Sunday surrendered before the Abohar police, nine days after a Dalit youth was found dead at the Akali leader’s farmhouse. He was produced before a duty magistrate on Sunday and sent to 10-day police remand.
Ferozepur range DIG A S Chahal said Amit will undergo a lie-detector test with Harpreet Parry.
Two other accused — Shiv Lal and Davinder Parry — are yet to be arrested.
“As per our investigation, Davinder Parry was the one who chopped off the limbs of Bheem Taank and Gurjant. We are conducting raids at several places to arrest him. Parry runs an abattoir and the weapons used in the crime were also the ones used in butcheries,” DIG Chahal said.
While being taken to court, however, Amit Doda protested his innocence and claimed that he was in a business meeting with Congress MLA Rana Sodhi, at the Oberoi Hotel in New Delhi on the day of the murder. The Congress MLA did not deny the claims but said that he was in a business meeting with Rajinder Chadha, the younger brother of Ponty Chadha, when he encountered Shiv Lal Doda and Amit Doda. “I met Amit Doda for the first time and we all sat together for about 30 minutes over a cup of tea. I later left the place at about 12.25 pm,” Rana Sodhi said.
With Amit’s surrender, the total number of accused in police custody has reached 13. Five more are yet to be arrested, said IG Bathinda range Jitendra Jain.
He added that both groups have criminal background and that victim Bheem Taank had 10 pending FIRs against him.
