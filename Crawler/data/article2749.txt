Production house Yash Raj Films (YRF) is set to start its own independent VFX division, titled yFX.
yFX will have Bollywood superstar Salman Khan and actress Anushka Sharma-starrer “Sultan” as its first film. To be directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, the film is currently under production.
“The Indian film industry is pushing the envelope with every film and visual effects will play a bigger part than ever before in Indian cinema. Like Hollywood films, Indian films too will become an event by itself which means more effects and larger than life imagery!
“This state-of-the-art facility will be housed in YRF Studios making YRF a fully integrated studio in every sense of the word,” Akshaye Widhani, vice-president, Finance & Business Affairs at Yash Raj Films, said in a statement issued on the official site of YRF.
With yFX, the Indian visual effects industry finally comes of age, observed Pankaj Khandpur, creative director of yFX.
“Visual effects will now be treated on par with all the other critical departments in filmmaking, contributing to the process from day one: from the ideation of the script itself, all the way through to final world-class execution, thanks to our experienced, skilled and passionate team of designers, supervisors and artists,” he said.
