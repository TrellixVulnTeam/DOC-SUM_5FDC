A sedan, an eatery on Pakmodia Street and tenancy rights to a property in Matunga, once owned by underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, will go for auction on December 9. The auction to be carried out by a private firm under the Smugglers & Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Properties) Act 1976 will be the second time that some of his properties in Mumbai go under the hammer. Four more properties in Nani Daman will be auctioned too.
Hotel Rounak Afroz
Located a few steps away from Dawood’s residence in Nagpada.
Reserve price: Rs 1.18 crore.
Earnest money deposit: Rs 30 lakh
The fugitive don owned this popular eatery. “It was a very popular joint, the tikka dishes especially were spectacular. A lot of people used to gather there but when the brand changed to ‘Delhi Zaika’, less people frequented. However, the place has been seized and shut since 2013,” said a shopkeeper on Pakmodia Street. Of all his properties, this is the highest valued property.
Hyundai Accent: MH 04 AX 3676
Reserve price: Rs 15,700.
Earnest money deposit: Rs 4,000
The green sedan has been parked under a banyan tree inside a government society in Ghatkopar for the last four years. The car is in a wrecked condition, and has several empty bottles, wafer packets and a black t-shirt among other things inside. The rear, right door is unlocked, window rolled down, tyres burst and the windshield completely smashed. Locals vehemently oppose the fact that it’s Dawood’s car: “If it’s Dawood’s car, why isn’t the police guarding it?”
Tenancy right of Room Number 8, Mahavir Building
Bhandarkar Road, measuring 32.77 square metres.
Reserve Price: Rs 50,44,000.
Earnest money deposit: Over Rs 12 lakh
Mahavir Building, with 315 tenements, is currently preparing for redevelopment and most of the occupants have vacated their flats. Developers Satra Properties have already begun demolition work. The project manager at the site said, “Construction will start soon. We can’t give any details regarding the auction until December 9.” A resident said, “I have lived here since the 1980s but didn’t know Dawood owned a room here.”
