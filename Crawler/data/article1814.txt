Guwahati, May 22 (PTI) NCERT will place before its Textbook Development Committee a proposal to include tea as a chapter in its textbooks following a request by the North East Tea Association (NETA) in this regard. 	NETA had appealed to the Union Human Resources Development Minister Smriti Zubin Irani to include a chapter on Tea and its role in the economy and society in the school textbooks, its advisor Bidyanand Barkakoty said.
In its reply, NCERT had said in a letter the National Education Policy was in the process of being formulated and as a follow-up, curriculum framework and other teaching learning materials would be developed.
This would be placed before the Textbook Development Committee during revision of textbooks, the letter said.
Contents related to tea have been already included at relevant places in all geography textbooks from Class VI to Class VIII, it said.
Tea is an important crop in the country and keeping this in view, geographic conditions for its cultivation and tea leaves harvesting by women have been illustrated through textbooks. Distribution of tea areas in the country has also been shown through maps, the letter added.
