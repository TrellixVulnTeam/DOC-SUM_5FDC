The Supreme Court Friday declined to stay the contempt proceedings initiated against writer Arundhati Roy over an article criticising the incarceration of Delhi University professor G N Saibaba over his alleged links with Maoists.
A bench led by Justice J S Khehar also refused to exempt the Booker Prize winner from her personal appearance
pursuant to a notice issued to her by the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court, and directed Roy to appear there on January 25.
Saibaba had been arrested by Maharashtra Police for his alleged links with Maoists. Roy had questioned his extended incarceration by writing an article, published in the Outlook magazine.
