One of the popular Tv shows Sarabhai vs Sarabhai is something most fans will wish to hit the small screen again. The series came to an end in the year 2006. In 2012, actor and director of the show had said that there will be no coming back for the Sarabhais.
But a ray of hope for the fans is this picture, posted by Producer JD Majethia on Twitter, where the cast of the show is seen posing happily. The reunion of the cast at Satish Shahâ€™s house in Mumbai, indicates a good news and so do the caption of the image which reads: Sarabhai family at satish ji â€˜s placeâ€¦. Some good news for fans on its way ðŸ˜œðŸ˜†
