Virat Kohli, the record breaking machine, added more milestones to his name on the second day of the first Test against West Indies. The latest record for the Indian skipper sees him go past Mohammad Azharuddin with the highest score by an Indian captain away from home. Azhar had previously scored 192 against New Zealand in Auckland in 1989-90 season.
Kohli was chasing the overall record held by MS Dhoni who scored 224 against Australia in Chennai in 2013 but the current India skipper was dismissed first ball after session break, without adding a run to his score. Other names in this list include Sachin Tendulkar (217 vs New Zealand), Sunil Gavaskar (205 vs West Indies) and Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi (203* vs England).
In his fantastic inning that began a little after lunch on day one, Kohli also went past his highest Test score of 169 against Australia in the Boxing Day Test of 2014 at MCG.
