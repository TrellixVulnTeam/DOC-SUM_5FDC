The Twitter showdown between Kamaal R Khan and filmmaker Vikram Bhatt, has finally come to a peaceful end. Vikram Bhatt had earlier protested against KRK's derogatory remarks towards a female colleague, and his tendency to bully a lot of celebrities on Twitter. Vikram Bhatt had written an open letter where he asked if KRK wanted to be known as a respected critic or a troll.
Kamaal R Khan or KRK (as he is popularly known) responded to Bhatt's open letter by saying that he agreed with him and thanked Bhatt for showing him the right way.
Anyway thanks Mr. @TheVikramBhatt for giving me very good advise n I am sorry if I hurt you in the past. Cheers and best of luck for future.
I m sorry to all other Bollywood ppl also if I have hurt anyone by my statement or review. Today a new very serious type of critic has born.
 
@kamaalrkhan you are a talented critic and people will take you seriously now because you are not a troll anymore :) cheers!
 
Kamaal R Khan has been known to give his 'critiques' on the latest releases and for passing lewd comments at actresses like Bipasha Basu, Lisa Haydon, Alia Bhatt and Nargis Fakhri. It will be interesting to see if he mends his ways after this incident.
