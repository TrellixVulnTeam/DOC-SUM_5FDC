THE Enforcement Directorate (ED) has registered a case of money-laundering against Congress leader and former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and others on the allotment of a plot in Panchkula to Associate Journals Limited (AJL), the publisher of The National Herald newspaper.
Apart from Hooda, officials of AJL, the publisher of The National Herald, and other individuals allegedly linked to the allotment have been named in the Enforcement Case Investigation Report (ECIR), which is similar to an FIR.
The ED case is based on an FIR filed on the allotment by the Haryana State Vigilance Bureau in May.
The Indian Express was the first to report — in December 2015 — on alleged irregularities in the allotment of the 3,360-sq-m plot in Sector 6, Panchkula, to AJL. The plot was allotted by the previous Hooda-led Congress government six months after it came to power in Haryana in 2005.
According to ED sources, as ex-officio chairman of the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) at the time, Hooda caused a loss of Rs 65 lakh to the exchequer by granting the land to AJL in alleged contravention of rules and against the advice of government officials.
Sources said the discrepancies had been flagged in a state audit report.
ED sources said the allotment under the scanner was related to AJL’s Hindi newspaper “Navjeevan”. In 1982, AJL was allotted the plot by the Haryana government on the condition that it would complete construction within two years.
”At that time, the plot was bought for Rs 57 lakh,” said an ED official.
However, AJL did not begin construction and in 1992, the allotment was cancelled. AJL’s subsequent appeal against the move was rejected in 1995. “The money was returned to AJL after 10 per cent was deducted as penalty,” said the ED official.
The company then appealed to the then chief minister Bansi Lal’s office, which rejected the plea in 1998.
In 2005, AJL submitted another plea, this time to the Congress government under Hooda in 2005, with Congress leader Motilal Vora requesting that the land be re-allotted to AJL at the 1982 rates, said ED officials.
”There are file notings where Hooda’s bureaucrats have said that this can’t be done. It is clearly written that the land must be auctioned and allotted at market rate. But Hooda re-allotted the land to AJL at 1982 rates,” said the ED official.
According to ED officials, the re-allotment was allowed on condition that AJL would complete the construction within six months.
But AJL failed to do so, and when issued a notice, said it was still at the stage of getting drawings done for construction and sought more time. In 2008, it submitted the drawings and asked for two more years to complete the construction which was granted, said ED sources.
In 2010, AJL allegedly asked the government for one more year for construction, which was granted, ED sources said. “But it completed construction only in 2013, by which time “Navjeevan” had ceased to exist,” the ED official said.
”A state audit report had flagged in 2005 that a loss of Rs 65 lakh had been caused due to the re-allotment of land to AJL at 1982 rates. The actual market rate in 2005 was several times higher. Today, the land is worth over Rs 100 crore,” the ED official claimed.
On May 5, the state vigilance bureau registered a case of cheating and corruption against Hooda and four officials in HUDA for allegedly re-alloting the plot to AJL. Hooda had termed the action as “political vendetta” and said there was no wrongdoing.
The vigilance case was registered under various IPC sections, including criminal breach of trust by a public servant, cheating, criminal conspiracy and under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
A separate FIR had been lodged last December by the state vigilance bureau against Hooda as the then chairman and chief administrator of HUDA for alleged irregularities in allotment of industrial plots in Panchkula three years ago. Hooda had then said that no rules had been violated.
