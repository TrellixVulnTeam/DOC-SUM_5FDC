Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi has cancelled his two-day visit to Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, which was to commence on Tuesday, as he is suffering from high fever.
“Unfortunately I have been down with high fever since Sunday and the doctor has advised rest for the next two days,” the 45-year-old Congress leader said on micro-blogging site Twitter late Monday night.
“My apologies to the ppl of Puducherry, Tamil Nadu & Kerala for missing this opportunity of being with them on 10th &11th May as planned.
“Shall keep everyone updated about the rescheduled visits,” Rahul said in his tweets.
Rahul was scheduled to address a rally of the Congress-DMK alliance on Tuesday at Karaikal in Puducherry.
On Monday, top Congress leaders had met Home Minister Rajnath Singh seeking adequate security to the party Vice President following an anonymous letter threatening to attack Rahul and former union minister V Narayanasamy at an election meeting in Puducherry.
AICC General Secretary Narayanasamy had said in Puducherry that he had received an “unsigned letter” threatening to attack him and Rahul.
The Special Protection Group and the Intelligence Bureau were on Monday ordered by the government to take maximum precautions for Rahul Gandhi’s security in the wake of the threat letter.

Acting swiftly, Union Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi directed the SPG, responsible for the protection of the Congress vice president, and the IB to take all necessary precautionary measures in this regard.
Mehrishi’s missive to the two agencies came soon after Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh asked him to take up the issue seriously and ensure protection to Rahul, official sources said.
