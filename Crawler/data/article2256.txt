Odd-even cannot be a long-term remedy: Kejriwal ||||
 Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday admitted that "odd-even cannot be a long-term remedy" to combat air pollution in the national capital. He said public transport will be improved within a year to reduce the number of vehicles on Delhi's roads.

At an event to thank the people of Delhi and volunteers for the second round of odd-even scheme, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal brought up the issue of the fires at Bhalswa and Ghazipur landfills and held the opposition responsible for them.
“Inhone Ghazipur, Bhalswa mein aag laga di (They started the fires in Bhalswa and Ghazipur),” said the CM. A four-member committee appointed by the Delhi government to probe the fires had said they were caused by ‘unknown human error’.
On the second phase of the scheme, the CM said, “Media and opposition called it a failure but I… saw that people were happy”. He said odd-even was not a permanent solution and public transport services had to be improved to curb pollution levels.

Many civil defence volunteers were not allowed to enter the venue as they were dressed in black. Rekha Singh, in-charge of civil defence volunteers, said participants had been told about the “dress code and advised not to wear black”.
