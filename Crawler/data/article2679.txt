Anushka said, “Phillauri has a unique premise. It took almost 100 years, a crazy Punjabi wedding and rank strangers to complete this love story, and that’s the crux of the film.”
“Anushka Sharma is a phenomenal actress and has proven that she is a producer par excellence with her brave first film. We are thrilled to be working with her,” said Vijay Singh, CEO, Fox Star Studios.
The actress seems to be taking a new challenge each year. Apart from starring in Sultan opposite Salman Khan, she now has double the work on her shoulders with Phillauri in line.
