India on Sunday welcomed the passage of two amendments dealing with representation of Madhesis in Nepali Parliament as “positive” and hoped that remaining outstanding issues will also be dealt with constructively.
“We regard the two amendments passed yesterday by the Nepali Parliament as positive developments. We hope that other outstanding issues are similarly addressed in a constructive spirit,” External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Vikas Swarup said.
The new bill promises Madhesis, as well as members of other marginalised or impoverished communities, higher representation in government bodies on the basis of proportional inclusion.
It also potentially enhances their electoral representation by making population the main criteria for drawing up constituencies — a move which will likely generate more seats for lawmakers in the densely-populated southern plains that are home to most Madhesis.
However, Madhesis, who share close cultural, linguistic and family links with Indians living across the border, said the bill was incomplete and does not address their main demand to revise the federal state borders laid out in the charter that they fear will limit their representation in Parliament.
