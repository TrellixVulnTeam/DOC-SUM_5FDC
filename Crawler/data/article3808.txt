Lamenting poor contribution of the country’s premier management and engineering schools, senior BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi said Wednesday that the IITs and IIMs were only good at producing trained work force for the first world.
Joshi, who was speaking at 5th National Summit on Instituionalising Academia-Industry interface organised by PHD chamber, said, “The IITs and IIMs are in a bad position… they are only contributing to transfer of capital to developed countries. We are not creating opportunities here and the students who pass out from these institutes are only contributing to management of multinational companies of other countries.”
He said the country is focusing more on borrowing technology rather than creating technology.
