Maharashtra Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Vinod Tawde, who is mulling the idea of making yoga part of the school curriculum Wednesday tweeted that students practising yoga every day will be awarded marks like in sports. Tawde tweeted this after attending a yoga session in Mumbai with Baba Ramdev.
Tawde late on Wednesday night tweeted: “Urged students to benefit from yoga, students practising yoga everyday will be awarded marks like in sports.”
Last year in June during a yoga session at a municipal school in Vile Parle on International Yoga Day, Tawde had openly asked students and teachers whether they would like to have yoga as a subject or part of their physical education class.
Tawde said, “Why can’t marks be awarded to students for yoga. This will encourage more and more students to practice yoga from the early age.”
According to Tawde, instead of spending free time surfing internet and becoming a “couch potato” by continuously watching TV, students can practice yoga and enjoy its benefit. “Learning Yoga from an early age is very beneficial as it would not only help students maintain their health, but also help them concentrate on academics,” he added.
Even earlier on several occasions Tawde had hinted that the state government was seriously thinking of incorporating yoga in the school curriculum.
“We are currently discussing the idea with yoga experts, academicians, school managements and officials of the school education department on how we can go about it. The idea of awarding marks too will be discussed with academicians.”
