THE SUPREME Court Tuesday directed the Maharashtra government to give licences to eight dance bars within two days.
A bench led by Justice Dipak Misra also asked the bar operators to give an undertaking that they would not engage employees with criminal antecedents near the dance area.
The order came after the Maharashtra government informed the court that they had not granted licences to dance bars since they found some of their employees with criminal antecedents. The court also took strong exception to a submission by a lawyer that criminal antecedents of dancers should also be looked into and conditions be imposed on them.
“Are you trying to convey to us that they are criminals? Nobody can earn livelihood if they are convicted. We want to save the dignity of women. You want to take away means of their livelihood. Dignity of women has to be maintained and no obscenity of any kind would be allowed,” the bench replied.
The court has fixed the matter for further hearing on May 13.
