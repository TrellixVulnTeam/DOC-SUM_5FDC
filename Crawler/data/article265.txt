THE SUPREME Court Friday asked actor Rajpal Yadav to serve out remainder six days of the jail term in case he fails to fork out immediately the money he owed to a Delhi-based businessman.
A bench of Justices Kurian Joseph and Rohinton F Nariman declined to pay heed to his lawyer’s argument that Yadav was left with no money after his movies failed at the box office.
“You have got rid of murder (by serving only six days). We were thinking of sending you to jail for six months,” said the bench.
Yadav was in jail from December 3, 2013 till December 6, 2013 after which the High Court had suspended the sentence on his appeal.
He moved the apex court challenging the High Court verdict asking him to serve out the remainder six days of the 10-day imprisonment for filing a false affidavit.
