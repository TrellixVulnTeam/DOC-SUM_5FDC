Ranveer Singh and Vaani Kapoor may be the stars of the moment with their upcoming Befikre getting all the limelight. However, when the duo posed along with the entire cast and crew for the filmâ€™s shoot wrap in France, the spotlight was on another couple â€” the extremely private Aditya Chopra and his wife, actor Rani Mukerji.

For those who could not spot Rani and Aditya in the throng, hereâ€™s a tip â€” they are standing top left. Aditya, the man who runs Yashraj Films, is known for shunning media in any form. So much so, we have hardly ever seen his pictures despite him being one of the most important producers-directors in Bollywood today. Even after Rani and Aditya tied the knot in a private ceremony in 2014, not one single picture made it to the media or even the omnipresent social media.
Aditya seems to have made an exception for Befikre, which is his return to direction after eight years. His last directorial venture was Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi. If this film is so close to Adityaâ€™s heart, we are pretty sure that YRF will make it the film of the year.
Even before the wrap picture was posted by Ranveer, the actor had us intrigued with the multiple looks of Befikre. Check out these kiss-and-tell posters and looks of the film and let us know if you agree that this may be the blockbuster Bollywood is waiting for this year. The film releases on December 9.
