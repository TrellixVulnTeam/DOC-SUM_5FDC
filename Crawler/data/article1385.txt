Tamil Nadu Congress chief EVKS Elangovan resigned from his position Saturday and intimated the party's high command of the same in a letter.
He took moral responsibility for the party's performance in the recent Assembly elections in the state.
Though the Congress had struck an alliance with the DMK ahead of elections, their coalition could not unseat the incumbent AIADMK from power. Jayalalithaa stormed back to power in the state winning 134 out of 232 seats in the Assembly. While the DMK substantially improved its tally to win 89 seats, the Congress could only win 8 out of the 41 seats it contested.
This was the first time since 1984 that an incumbent government was voted back to power in the state.
