Tendulkar, who underwent a knee surgery in London recently, is expected to be reasonably fit to travel to Rio and is keen to go there to support Team India.
His trip to Rio comes amid speculation that cricket could be included in the 2024 Games roster.
In his role as goodwill ambassador with the IOA, Tendulkar met the Rio-bound Indian wrestling contingent — comprising Narsingh Yadav, Vinesh Phogat, Babita Kumari, Sakshi Malik, Ravinder Khatri, and Hardeep — and also posted videos on his facebook page, profiling the athletes who have qualified for the Games.
Tendulkar is also an active member of the Parliament’s upper house — the Rajya Sabha.
