John Abraham says he grew up watching Hollywood action star Sylvester Stallone and his Rocky film series made the actor more interested in movies.
Fitness freaks across the country look up to John thanks to his well-built physique and enthusiasm for fitness but the “Force” star says he has been largely inspired by Stallone.
“For me, fitness is religion. Daily fitness is religion to me. While I was growing up, (actor) Sylvester Stallone is the only one I looked upto. I have seen ‘Rocky’ series and I was inspired by it. Since then my interest in films grew,” John told reporters here at a promotional event of “Dishoom”.
Action comedy “Dishoom”, also starring Varun Dhawan and Jacqueline Fernandez, is slated to hit the theatres on July 29.
John, 43, had a great time working with Varun on this film.
“Varun and I got along well. I am hopeful, in this film people will like our chemistry. We had fun,” the actor said.
When it comes to fitness, the 29-year-old “Badlapur” star struggles to match up to John’s dedication in the gym, while John finds it difficult to keep up with Varun on the dance floor.
At the event, both the stars gave gym tips to female scribes.
“Varun wanted to train everybody seriously at the gym. We wanted to give everybody tips,” the “Dostana” actor said.
