Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Kumari Mayawati Thursday alleged that the entire Dayashankar Singh episode that played out in Uttar Pradesh was a “pre-planned conspiracy” hatched by the BJP leaders to prevent her from visiting Gujarat, and to “divert the attention of Dalits from the Una episode in Gujarat youths were mercilessly beaten up in the name of Gau-Raksha.”
“I had decided that I will personally visit Una where the incident against the Dalits had happened. As soon as my (political) opponents came to know – especially the BJP government in the Centre and in Gujarat – they under a pre-planned conspiracy got their veteran BJP leader from Uttar Pradesh – Dayashankar Singh – attack me using derogatory language… BJP conspired so that I do not go to Una. This was done to prevent me from visiting Una,” said Mayawati who arrived in Ahmedabad Thursday noon and met the families of Una and Thangadh episodes near the statue of Dr BR Ambedkar at Sarangpur and offered them cash compensation of Rs 2 lakh each, in yellow envelopes.
“This was done intentionally, so that the attention of Dalits in the entire country gets shifted from the Una incident… I too got entangled (in this issue) and could not visit Una. But now that the anger of people across India has subsided, I decided to visit Gujarat,” Mayawati added.
She later headed to meet the Dalit victims who are admitted at the Ahmedabad civil hospital.
