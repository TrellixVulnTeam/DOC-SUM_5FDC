Prime Minister Narendra Modi attacked Mamata Banerjee Sunday for using the Bengal chief secretary’s office to reply to a showcause notice from the Election Commission. This violates of the model code of conduct, Modi said at his first rally in Kolkata this election; the EC had issued the notice to Mamata not as chief minister but as TMC chief and a poll contestant, he said.
“Didi could have got a lawyer to reply or her party could have replied. But she subverted the process of law,” Modi said. “Her defiance of the EC — ‘dekhungi, dekhungi, dekhungi’ — makes one doubt if she respects the Constitution or constitutional bodies like the EC.”
Modi addressed two meetings, the other one in Krishnanagar, where he said: “The Trinamool Congress has lost its senses. Mamata and her party have accepted defeat, and so she is not fighting political parties but she is fighting the Election Commission.”
Her raised the Narada sting in Kolkata: “The cast of characters in all the episodes from Saradha to Narada to the Vivekananda Bridge collapse are all same… Didi should apologise, take leave of office for five years and contemplate on her mistakes. People will pardon her.”
Modi also ridiculed the Congress-CPM alliance: “The communists have joined hands with the Congress in Bengal and are fighting them as the principal opponent in Kerala. They are insulting the judgment of the people. This game of duality cannot go on and people will not forgive.”
