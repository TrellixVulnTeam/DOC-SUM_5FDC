New Delhi, Jul 28 (PTI) Over 7,000 to 8,000 stationery products - from unique writing instruments to office equipments, art and school supplies to notebooks and diaries - will be up for grabs at the first edition of World Stationery Expo here.
Organised by MEX Exhibitions Pvt Ltd, the 3-day long fair will be hosted at Pragati Maidan here from July 29 to July 31.
The expo, that promises to be a "one-stop hub" for stationery supplies from across the globe, will exhibit products in distinguished budget ranges, targeted at small, medium and large offices, organizations and educational institutes.
"It is more of B2B and less of B2C. It is not targeted at end to end consumer requirements. For anyone who requires stationery for their office or institute, this is the place to be.
"It is targeted at institutional sales in terms of pens and art supplies, educational institute supplies. Everything from a small Rs 10 product to a few hundreds, all price ranges will be there," Himani Gulati, Director, Mex Exhibitions, said.
The fair will have two other shows - Gift expo and Office Expo - running parallel to the event at the same venue with both national companies and international brands exhibiting world class stationery.
