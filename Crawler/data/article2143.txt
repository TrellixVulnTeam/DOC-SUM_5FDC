Nitish Kumar is not PM material: RJD MP ||||
 RJD MP Mohammed Taslimuddin on Monday said that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is not "PM material" and is "daydreaming of becoming the Prime Minister". "How can a person run the country who could not provide sushasan (good governance) in his own state," he asserted. Notably, RJD Chief Lalu Prasad Yadav had earlier backed Nitish Kumar as a Prime-Ministerial face. ||||

Former union minister and senior RJD Lok Sabha MP Mohammad Taslimuddin on Monday said Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is not “PM material” and he is “day dreaming of becoming the prime minister” as he has failed to provide “sushashan” (good governance) in Bihar.
“Nitish Kumar is not PM material. How can a person run the country who could not provide sushashan in his own state which is witnessing a spate of killings,” Taslimuddin told reporters in Kishanganj.
“Kumar is day dreaming of becoming the prime minister by launching nationwide campaign against liquor but that will not fructify,” he added.
Taslimuddin, a five-term MP who represents Araria in Lok Sabha, said Kumar has failed to rein in the spate of killings that have taken place in recent past in the state.
“Administration has collapsed in the state. The chief minister is indulging in stunt show to deceit people…There is loot everywhere in Bihar as there is no control on government departments,” he said.
It was Nitish Kumar, who ran the government with BJP’s support, who first opened liquor shops in every nook and corner of the state “be it temple, mosque, chowk, school, hospital etc” and now he has suddenly enforced prohibition.
“I am not against prohibition but it should have been implemented in a phased manner,” the MP said.
