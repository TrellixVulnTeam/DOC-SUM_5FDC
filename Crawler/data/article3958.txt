A 21-year-old fell to his death, Friday morning, after losing his grip in an overcrowded suburban train in Mumbai. The incident was caught on camera by a fellow passenger, and subsequently, went viral.
Bhavesh Nakate was a resident of Dombivli and had taken a CST-bound train from Dombivli station to reach his office in CST.

Nakate fell between Kopri and Diva stations. Officials were informed about the accident by a fellow traveller.
“Railway officials reached the spot and ferried him to a hospital with the help of locals. However, he had died by then,” said an official of Dombivli railway station. Incidentally, Nakate’s Twitter handle has a display picture that shows him standing at the door of an empty train.
Suburban trains are packed, especially during peak hours, with eight people forced to stand in less than one square metre.
