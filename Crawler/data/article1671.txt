The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government to create a separate ministry for the welfare of cows.
The Bharatiya Govansh Rakshan Samvardhan Parishad (BGRSP), a group working under the VHP, has urged the Centre to fulfil its promise of saving the cow, which is considered holy in Hinduism.
The VHP is affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), which is also considered as the ideological mentor of the BJP.

The demand comes at a time when beef and its consumption has become an issue of controversy in the country.
There have been reports of the people getting targeted by self-styled cow protection groups, accusing them of cow slaughter.
According to BGRSP, a separate ministry for cow welfare was essential for ensuring a total ban on its slaughter, beef consumption and protection of the Indian breeds at a time when some of the breeds faced existential threat.
The BGRSP further said this issue of creation of separate cow welfare ministry will be raised during the Monsoon Session of Parliament, adding that several lawmakers are likely to lend their support.
