Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) for automobiles in the national capital region will cost Rs 1.5 per kg less during odd-hours – midnight to 5 am – with effect from midnight tonight.
The move to sell CNG at discount is aimed at reducing long queues at refueling stations, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said today.
This is the first time that a differential pricing for peak and off peak hours is being applied for CNG.
“From tomorrow, Indraprastha Gas Ltd will have a reduced price during odd hours,” he said.
CNG for automobiles in Delhi costs Rs 37.20 per kg. The price of CNG in adjoining towns of Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad is Rs 42.60 per kg.
The sole retailer of CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households in NCR will sell the fuel to automobiles at discounted rates between 0000 hrs or midnight to 0500 hrs, IGL company managing director Narendra Kumar said.
“The odd-hour discount will be Rs 1.50 per kg,” he said.
Pradhan said the total CNG dispensation capacity in NCR is 68 lakh kg per day against a demand of 22 lakh kg. “Yet there are queues. So I asked IGL to prepare a new marketing plan to decongest. The new plan will be implemented from tomorrow.”
IGL has 181 operational CNG stations in the national capital region catering to 8 lakh vehicles.
The company had last revised CNG prices with effect from October 2 when rates were cut by 80 paisa per kg following an 18 per cent reduction in natural gas prices. Piped cooking gas (PNG) on that day was reduced by 70 paise per unit.
The consumer price of PNG to the households in Delhi is Rs 24.65 per standard cubic meters.
Due to differential tax structure in the state of Uttar Pradesh, the applicable price of domestic PNG to households in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad is Rs 26.15 per scm.
