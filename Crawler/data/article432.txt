Encrypted copy of Dishoom given to Censor Board ||||
 An encrypted copy of 'Dishoom', starring John Abraham and Varun Dhawan, has been submitted to the Censor Board. 'Dishoom' became the first to opt for such means following the recent online leak of films, which were allegedly Censor Board copies. Producer Sajid Nadiadwala sent the film in DCP-KDM format, which allows only someone with due authorisation to access the file. ||||

The censor boards have certainly become an unreliable place to be trusted with stopping leaks of copies of films, sent for certification.Â  Therefore, producer Sajid Nadiadwala is leading the way by making Dishoom the first film to send an encrypted copy to the censor board.

The recent leaks of films like Udta Punjab, Great Grand Masti and even Kabali have caused monetary losses to the producers of all films associated. Even though Udta Punjab, Sultan and Kabali didn't feel the pinch because of the overwhelming response, but the producers of Great Grand Masti bit the dust because of the leaks.
The makers of Dishoom, instead of sending a DVD, sent the film in DCP-KDM format which keeps the files encrypted and only someone with due authorisation are able to open it. Nadiadwala also added, "I am going to put this up before the Indian Film and Television Producers Council and tell them about the safety of this system."
The encryption will definitely help to fight the piracy surrounding films in Bollywood. In layman's terms, once the film starts playing the disc gets locked and does not allow duplication. However, this technology costs a bomb at Rs 20,000 compared to the Rs 3000 producers used to pay earlier to submit a DVD. But the producers think the investment is worth it.
