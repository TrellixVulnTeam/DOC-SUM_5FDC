An Indian Air Force plane carrying 23 personnel and six crew members, onboard went missing Friday while making its way back to Port Blair from Chennai. The An-32 aircraft, which was on a routine courier-run, took off from Chennai at 8.30 am and was expected to arrive at 11.30 am at Port Blair. The aircraft, however, went missing at 9.15 am after climbing to an altitude of 23,000 feet.
Rescue operations are currently underway to locate the aircraft. But extensive searches have not so far been able to locate the aircraft. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said that all efforts are being made to trace the aircraft and the service personnel on board.
Five military planes and four Navy warships have been dispatched to assist rescue efforts in Bay of Bengal. Media reports claim that bad weather could have played a role in forcing the aircraft off its flight path.
Three snags were reported in the same An-32 aircraft in the month of July itself. The An-32 aircraft is a twin-engined turboprop military transport aircraft.
