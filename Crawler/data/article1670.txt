Won't fund states with power scheme frauds: Govt ||||
 Power Minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday said the Centre will stop funding states found indulging in irregularities in procuring material for rural electrification and urban power infrastructure schemes. He urged the states to study the benefits of joining the common procurement pool. Common procurement helps keep the process honest and keep a tab on quality, he reasoned. ||||

Panaji, Jun 16 (PTI) The Centre will stop funding states that are found indulging in irregularities in procurement of material for its flagship schemes for rural electrification and urban upgradation of power infrastructure, Power Minister Piyush Goyal warned today.
"I would request states which are not willing to join the common procurement pool to study its benefits, do an apple to apple comparison, compare the specifications (from central pool) to that being procured with your own specifications, compare the prices before you take any decision.
"Any irregularity found by us at the Centre could actually cause us to stop the funding to the states which indulge in any activity which are not in the best interest of the people of India," Goyal told the ministers and secretaries of states at a 2-day conference here.
"Dinadayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana and the integrated power development scheme are largely funding the investments in this roll out of rural electrification and urban upgradation," he said.
"We will be watching and closely monitoring the technology and quality of products that are being bought by the states. We will be monitoring the pricing at which these are being bought and transparency with which these are being purchased.
"Any problemsï¿½associated with the quality, technology, pricing or corruption that are brought to our notice will be promptly put up on the website (of the ministry)," Goyal said.
So, it is the choice that different states can make, he said, adding, "If you believe that you can do it better than central procurement, you are welcome. But the strength of this programme is the fact that we are all in it together and we are combining our procurement and...combined requirement helps us to do process more honesty and helps us to keep tab on quality control".
