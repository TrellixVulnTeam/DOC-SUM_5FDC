Amazon Prime is here. What the heck is Amazon Prime you might ask. Well, it’s best summarised by Amazon itself: Amazon fulfilled + free fast delivery. But what it actually is is another big blow for Flipkart, the homegrown e-commerce giant.
Amazon Prime users will be able to get free shipping for anything they order with no price cap. They will also be able to secure one or two day deliveries for free. There will be 30-minute early access to new deals too.
All this will cost them Rs 499 per year. For now, there is a 60-day free trial period. This Rs 499 is a Rs 500 discount on list price of Rs 999 per year for the service. At an additional cost Prime users will get morning delivery in up to 20 cities. Not everything will be eligible for Prime, so you will need to look for the Prime logo against products.
Amazon Prime Videos is also headed to India and will be available for those buying into the service now. In markets like the US, this means original and exclusives shows as well as popular movies.
“With Prime, guaranteed one-day delivery becomes an everyday experience instead of an occasional indulgence, and with no minimum purchases, it provides unlimited convenience all year long,” says Amit Agarwal, Vice-President & Country Head, Amazon India.

Amazon has of late been looking at India as a growth market and has pumped in billions of dollars to capture market share and mind space. Most of this growth has been at the cost of longtime market leader Flipkart. Incidentally, the Indian e-commerce company has Flipkart First which is very similar to Amazon Prime and costs as much for an annual subscription.
The e-commerce race in India is truly hitting up and the consumer is emerging the king.
