New Delhi, May 22 (PTI) Amping up its offensive against the Left Front in Kerala, a BJP delegation today met President Pranab Mukherjee over attacks on party workers allegedly by CPI(M) supporters and also questioned the silence of Congress, saying it is not good for democracy.
Union minister Nitin Gadkari told reporters after meeting the President that BJP and RSS workers were facing "atrocities" from CPI(M), which led the alliance that won the Assembly polls in the state.
He alleged that police was not taking appropriate action.
"We have given the President details of these cases, including photographs. Our worker Pramod was killed. Houses of more than 100 workers have been vandalised. Situation is not good. He has assured us that he will take appropriate action.
"Unfortunately, UPA, Congress are keeping quiet. This is not good for democracy. Democracy is a battle of ideas and parties cannot grow by taking law into their hands. We hope that those having faith in democracy will condemn this violence," he said.
Asked about CPI(M)'s charge that BJP was misleading, he said details of the incidents have been submitted to Mukherjee.
Besides Gadkari, the delegation included Union ministers J P Nadda, Nirmala Sitharaman and Rajiv Pratap Rudy, MPs Meenakshi Lekhi and M J Akbar and Kerala BJP President Kummanam Rajasekharan.
Attacking the Left Front, BJP chief Amit Shah had yesterday accused it of "violating" the people's mandate as his party said it will not sit quiet and fight on the streets if violence continues.
