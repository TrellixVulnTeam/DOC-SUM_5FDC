AN ARMY jawan died during training session in Arunachal Pradesh on Sunday, following which other jawans roughed up the Captain who was in charge of the training.
Guwahati-based defence PRO Lt Colonel Suneet Newton said the jawan died in a field ambulance after he collapsed during a routine march.
“The jawan complained of chest pain prior to the routine march, but was checked by the unit medical officer and found fit. The jawan later collapsed during route march, was taken to the field ambulance where he succumbed,” Lt Col Newton said in a press release.
Though some reports quoting unofficial sources said the jawans of the entire unit went on a “mutiny”, the Defence PRO said “only a few (4-5) jawans got emotional and agitated”.
The jawans also “indulged in agitated behaviour leading to a minor scuffle”, the PRO said, adding that no one sustained serious injuries. “The incident is being investigated as is the practice in all cases of death during training,” he said.
The name and other details of the jawan who died during training was not readily available.
