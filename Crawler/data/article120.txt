Sunny Leone is Bollywood’s surprise package and the actress’ growth trajectory says it all. An adult star who surprised the country with her no-nonsense demeanour on Bigg Boss and with her successful Bollywood stint, Sunny Leone is all professionalism. And just when we are getting used to this, she has again reminded us that when it comes to purely being hot, no one can beat her.
Sunny Leone shot for the calendar of a condom brand with ace photographer Daboo Ratnani and this (see below) is the result. When we said Sunny is redefining hotness, we were hardly off the mark, right? This is the first shot which landed and considering there are 11 more months to go, this is going to be a Sunny Leone bonanza. Oh wait, we have got the second pic for you too, you just gotta scroll.
Earlier, Sunny Leone faced some legal trouble when a police complaint was filed against the actress for mispronouncing some words in the national anthem at the opening of Pro Kabaddi League (season 4). The complaint was filed in New Delhi after Sunny was invited to sing the national anthem during the televised sporting event.
The actress is breaking new ground in Bollywood as well. A one-woman army when it comes to keeping India’s adult comedy, adult horror genre in business, she will also be seen in Tera Intezaar opposite Arbaaz Khan. And he is not the only Khan who would appear opposite Sunny.She has shot for an item number in Shah Rukh Khan’s much-awaited Raees. There is buzz that Sunny may be seen in a song in Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil which stars Ranbir Kapoor.
