The Syndicate of Mahatma Gandhi University in Kottayam has decided to remove the head of a teaching department on charges of caste discrimination towards a Dalit woman research scholar.
Based on a sub-committee report, the Syndicate on Monday recommended police to register a case against Prof Nandakumar Kalarikkal under relevant sections of SC/ST ( Atrocities Prevention ) Act.
The university also served a notice to Kalarikkal to explain why severe action should not be taken against him.
Kalarikkal is the head of the Centre for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology. Last year, Dalit student Deepa M Mohan, who is doing her PhD in the department, had complained that she had been denied access to department facilities and lab as part of caste discrimination she was subjected to undergo.
In one occasion, she was even locked inside the lab.
Despite being a registered research scholar, she was not allowed to use study materials. Often, she had to depend upon study stuff borrowed from others.
Subsequently, she moved a complaint with the University vice chancellor who asked a syndicate subcommittee to probe into the complaint.
