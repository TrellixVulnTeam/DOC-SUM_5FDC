There has been over 50 per cent drop in corruption complaints received by Central Vigilance Commission, Union Minister Jitendra Singh said on Wednesday.
In 2014, the Central Vigilance Commission received 62,363 complaints while in 2015 the complaints dropped to 29,838, the minister said in a written reply in Lok Sabha.
The CVC received 32,524 less number of complaints last year as against those received by it in 2014, a drop of about 52 per cent.
“The reason for the decline in the complaints received in 2015 as compared to the previous year is that in the year 2014, there were multiple complaints received in the Commission sent by some of the complainants containing the same allegations or issues,” said the Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions.
The CVC had received 37,039 and 31,432 complaints during 2012 and 2013 respectively.
He said the central government is committed to implement its policy of “zero tolerance” against corruption and has taken several measures to combat graft and improve the functioning of the government and make it more effective and corruption-free.
