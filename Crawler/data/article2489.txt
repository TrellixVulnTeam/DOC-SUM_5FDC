Filmmaker Sajid Khan, who has directed the successful franchisee “Housefull” and “Housefull 2” himself choose to step out of “Housefull 3”, says producer Sajid Nadiadwala.
Asked why Sajid Khan didn’t direct “Housefull 3”, Nadiadwala said: “Sajid Khan didn’t want to because he was busy with ‘Himmatwala’ then. Besides, this is a difficult genre to write also; after sometime they also say we don’t want to because the genre gets saturated so it becomes difficult to edit and make a trailer for this film. Usually, a writer after one or two films gets into a saturation mode.”


Eros International and NGE’s “Housefull 3”, featuring Akshay Kumar, Riteish Deshmukh, Abhishek Bachchan, Jacqueline Fernandez, Nargis Fakhri, and Lisa Haydon, is directed by Sajid-Farhad and releases on June 3.
