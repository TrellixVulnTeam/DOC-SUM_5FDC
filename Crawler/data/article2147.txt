Director Sabbir Khan, currently enjoying the success of his film “Baaghi”, says talks are going on to make its sequel.
“We just set out to make this one but right now, I would not lie. We have been talking about a sequel just because of the kind of love that we got. It’s been a casual conversation though,” Khan told IANS.
Produced by Sajid Nadiadwala, “Baaghi” features Tiger Shroff and Shraddha Kapoor.
Going by his choice of actors, does he prefer newcomers over stars?
“When I thought of making a film with a newcomer, there was greed of glory that I can be in the forefront and make a film that people love. Sometimes, there are pros and cons working with stars. You have to make a film around them, but sometimes you can reinvent the actors so it works both the ways,” he said.


Khan, who started his career as a filmmaker with stars like Akshay Kumar and Kareena Kapoor in the 2009 film “Kambakkht Ishq”, later went on to make movies with newcomers like Tiger and Kriti Sanon in “Heropanti”.
