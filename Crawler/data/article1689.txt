The makers of Udta Punjab got a major relief as the Supreme Court on Thursday rejected the plea of an NGO to stay the release of the film. Human Rights Awareness Association, an NGO, had yesterday moved the apex court to stall the screening of the film which focuses on the widespread drug menace in the agrarian state.
A vacation bench of justices Adarsh Kumar Goel and L. Nageswara Rao, however, granted liberty to the NGO to approach the High Court with its prayer.
