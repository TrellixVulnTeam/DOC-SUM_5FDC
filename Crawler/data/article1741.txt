Mumbai, May 23 (PTI) Nawazuddin Siddiqui has earned the tag of an intense actor courtesy films like "Gangs of Wasseypur", "Liar's Dice" and "The Lunchbox", but the actor says he would love to feature in a slap-stick comedy.
"I would definitely love to do a slap-stick comedy. There is no apprehension from my side. If I get a good script, I will also do a film like that," Nawazuddin told PTI.
The 42-year-old "Bombay Talkies" star will be seen trying his hands at romantic genre in actor-director Sohail Khan's next.
"I am playing a golfer in the film. We have already started shooting for it. I will be seen romancing Amy Jackson and I am quite excited."
When asked if the romance will be in the style of his "Raees" co-star Shah Rukh Khan, Nawazuddin said, "No, not that. His style is different. I will be doing it in my own way."
Nawazuddin will be next seen in filmmaker Anurag Kashyap's "Raman Raghav 2.0", which was screened at 69th Cannes film festival.
The "Kahaani" actor feels there should be no "class division" when it comes to films.
"When 'Gangs of Wasseypur' had gone to Cannes, the film received a wider reach with international media praising it. But a movie should not be restricted to just as a 'festival film'."
