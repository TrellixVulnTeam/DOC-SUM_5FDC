Veteran actor Dharmendra says if a biopic is made on him, there is no one in Bollywood, who can portray him perfectly.
The 80-year-old actor, who was in the capital to promote his son Sunny Deol’s upcoming directorial venture “Ghayal Once Again,” said he has no desire to make a biopic on himself.
“I don’t think anybody is so colourful in nature like me. The way I have done things, it is tough for anyone else to do it that way. But, I will never make a biopic on myself. The life once lived is lived. I have lived this life beautifully, with truthfulness, with romance, with fun,” he said. (Will love to act with dad Dharmendra and son Karan: Sunny Deol)
