Trump rallies have of late seen protesters calling out the GOP candidate for his controversial remarks against Muslims.
Security officials at Trump rallies now urge participants not to harm any protesters but to just shout ‘Trump! Trump! Trump!’ whenever they spot one. In this case, protesters were heard chanting “USA, USA, USA”, ABC News reports.
