Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Mozambique, the Union Cabinet Tuesday gave its approval to a long-term contract through an MoU with the African country for the import of pulses.
The import would happen wither through private channels or government-to-government sales through state agencies nominated by the two countries, a government statement said.
The MoU is aimed at promoting the production of Pigeon Peas/Tur and other pulses in Mozambique by encouraging progressive increase in the trading of these pulses. The MOU includes targets for exports of Tur and other pulses from Mozambique to India for five financial years and aims at doubling the trade from 100,000 tonnes in 2016-17 to 200,000 tonnes is 2020-21.

“The MoU will augment domestic availability of pulses in India and thereby stabilise its prices,” Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters.
The total pulses production in the country during 2015-16 is estimated to be 17 million tonnes while 5.79 million tonnes of pulses were imported to meet the domestic demand. But even that quantity proved to be too less to neutralise an increase in the prices of pulses in 2015-16 and the current year. To mitigate the shortfall in availability of pulses and supplement the existing efforts at meeting the requirements, the centre has decided to enter into longterm arrangement with Mozambique so as to ensure assured availability of pulses. The signing of this MoU may also lead to similar arrangements with other countries, the government said.
