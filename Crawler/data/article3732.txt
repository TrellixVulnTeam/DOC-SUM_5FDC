While the price cut sounds like an attractive deal, is the iPhone 5s the best option for you?
If your budget is tight, and Apple iPhone is what you desire above all, iPhone 5s is not a bad option. Knowing the quality of Apple devices, this one will easily last you two years without trouble.
However, there’s a caveat to keep in mind. There’s a chance that the iPhone 5s, (launched in 2013) might not get the iOS 10 update or if the update comes, the phone might just become more buggy as it has happened in the past for some users on older iOS devices. Plus some of newer features might be restricted to iPhone 6 series and above.
Unlike Google where not every OEM pushes out updates on time, Apple’s iOS updates are what make the whole experience worthwhile and not getting the full experience can be frustrating. But if you plan to use this phone for a year and will upgrade soon, the iPhone 5s is a great deal.
However if you plan to use this phone for more than two years, it just seems overpriced.  The iPhone 6 makes a better choice, even though it’s currently retailing for over Rs 40,000 on sites like Infibeam and Amazon. If you buy the iPhone 6 via Paytm, you get Rs 6000-7000 cashback.
If you buy the iPhone 6 on Amazon, the e-commerce portal has tied up with Reglobe to offer assured 50 per cent buyback within six months of purchase and assured 40 per cent buyback within 15 months of purchase. You can consider this option, and it might make upgrading to the iPhone 7 a slightly cheaper exercise in 2016.
Snapdeal also has a similar offer of buyback on the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, which you can consider, before hitting buy on any one site.
