External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Sunday said that China is not protesting membership of India in NSG. Stating that China is talking only about the criteria and procedures to be adopted for membership of the elite 48-nation atomic trading bloc, Swaraj said India was hopeful that it will be able to convince China to give its backing. The NSG works under the principle of unanimity and even one country’s vote against India can scuttle its bid.
At a press conference in the national capital, to highlight her ministry’s achievements over the last two years, Swaraj spoke on range of issues including terrorism, economic ties with different countries, FDI Vijay Mallya and Lalit Modi.
