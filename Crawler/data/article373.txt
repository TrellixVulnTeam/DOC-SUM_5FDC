Rajinikanth-starrer Tamil action drama Kabali on Tuesday entered the Rs 200 crore club worldwide and an elated superstar thanked fans and everybody else associated with the film for the grand success. Rajinkanth wrote the letter in Tamil and signed it off with “magizhchi,” which stands for “Happy and thanks” in Tamil.
“My heartfelt gratitude to all those who made Kabali successful. From the producer to director to fans and to the media, I thank each and every one of them,” Rajinikanth said.
In the letter, he also wrote about his US sabbatical. “Since I was working non-stop on Kabali, and Shankar’s 2.o, I was required to take mental and physical rest. Hence, I went on a two-month long trip with my daughter, Aishwarya Dhanush, and during which time I had undergone a few medical tests,” he said, and added that he feels revitalised and motivated now.
“It’s the fastest south Indian film to rake in over Rs 200 crore at the box-office worldwide in just five days. As on Tuesday, Kabali has grossed Rs 205 crore and this includes the three languages in which the film was released,” trade analyst Trinath told IANS.
In India, in its opening weekend, the film minted over Rs 100 crore. “In the domestic market, the film collected a whopping Rs 128 crore from the opening weekend. It’s the best ever opening for a south Indian film,” he said.
Directed by Pa. Ranjith, Kabali narrates the story of a gangster’s shot at redemption and how he fights for equal pay rights for Tamils in Malaysia.
In a handwritten letter, Rajinikanth extended gratitude to fans, producer Kalaipuli S. Thanu, director Ranjith, theatre owners and distributors, for the grand success of his latest outing.
