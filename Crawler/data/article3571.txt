Stating that Hyderabad is for Hyderabadis, MIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Thursday called upon people to reject outsiders in the ensuing elections to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). He said Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) will contest 70-75 out of 150 seats.
Addressing a public meeting in Hyderabd, Owaisi said he was confident that an MIM leader will again become Hyderabad’s mayor. In the outgoing GHMC, MIM had shared power with Congress. Majid Hussain of MIM was mayor for three years.
At the public meeting, Owaisi had a dig at Congress party’s Telangana unit chief, Uttam Kumar Reddy, for his remarks against MIM and for meeting people involved in the bid on the life of his brother, Akbaruddin Owaisi.
Terming Congress leader an outsider, he launched a bitter attack on the party. The MP also trained guns on the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Owaisi, however, spared Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), triggering speculations that MIM will have an electoral understanding with the ruling party.
