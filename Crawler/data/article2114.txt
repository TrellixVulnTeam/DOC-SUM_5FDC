The Harish Rawat-led Congress party won the trust vote in the Uttarakhand Assembly and the Centre has informed the Supreme Court that it will revoke President’s Rule in the state later today.
The results were handed over to the Supreme Court in a sealed cover Wednesday morning. Rawat had 33 votes in his favour.
On Tuesday, the Congress claimed victory, saying they had the numbers to win the trust vote and they claimed their victory would be an end to the Centre’s attempts at destabilising Congress-ruled states.
In the voting on Tuesday, the Harish Rawat-led Congress got the support of BSP MLAs.
Congress MLA Rekha Arya who had distanced herself from the party in recent days reportedly voted in favour of the BJP, after she was seen arriving with BJP state chief Ajay Bhatt.
